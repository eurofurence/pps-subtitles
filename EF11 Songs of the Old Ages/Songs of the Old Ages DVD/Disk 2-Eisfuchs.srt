1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,990
Hello?

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,910
Hello?

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,060
I'm still up here!

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,410
Hey! Come back!

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,500
It's always the same.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,190
Hey, you assholes!

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,120
If you don't want me to be with you,

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,640
why don't you just tell me?

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,980
We're all grown-up people, aren't we?

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,920
Hey, come on! Give me a chance.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,220
I bet I can be a good prisoner, too!

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,980
Shit!

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,470
I gotta get down here by myself, then.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,770
I give up.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,420
I'm completely tangled in this ...

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,630
fucking parachute! Shit!

17
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,200
I'm stuck!

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,140
Lionel!

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,630
Mika!

20
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,790
Come back and get me down!

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,190
Lionel?

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,390
Mika?

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,920
Lori?

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,900
How am I ever supposed to get ...

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,450
out of this fucking tree?

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,700
Ooh! Out of my way! I can't stop!

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,430
Step aside! Incoming!

28
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,220
Uh oh ...

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,380
Timber!

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,350
Ow!

31
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,120
Oh, fuck!

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,190
Hey, what's up with you?

33
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,160
Have you been living in a cave?

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,460
And I thought Lori was a bad driver.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,340
Oh well, at least
I'm on the ground again.

36
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,340
I mean ... I like bondage but ...

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,660
this is ridiculous.

38
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,090
Okay ... now what?

39
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,380
These trees look all the same.

40
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,060
Should I go this way?

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,220
Or that way?

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,960
Or, what about the way back?

43
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,720
Come on, Poke, time to think.

44
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,540
You must think your way out of here!

45
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,700
Think!

46
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,100
Come on! Think!

47
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,180
Think! Thiii- ack!

48
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,140
I must have snapped
a muscle in my brain.

49
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,220
Man, that hurts!

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,820
I guess I'll just lie down here and ...

51
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,220
think a little bit more carefully.

52
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,470
Think!

53
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,000
Think!

54
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,480
Think!

55
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,950
Think!

56
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,570
Think!

57
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,180
Think!

58
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,740
Think!

59
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,490
Think!

60
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,800
Think!

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,540
Think!

62
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,980
Think!

63
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,770
Thi- uh ... Think!

64
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,310
Think!

65
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,590
Think!

66
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,610
Hey! Hey!

67
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,060
Can't you see here's a genius at work?

68
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,240
How am I supposed to think with ...

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
all this ooga-booga stuff going on?

70
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,720
So?

71
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,930
Hey, stop complaining!

72
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,840
We're doing an important job!

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,940
Does it look like we're
running about just for fun?

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,260
Who are you, anyway?

75
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,870
Hey, that's funny. I just wanted to
ask you the same thing.

76
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,360
We are the honorable carriers of ...

77
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,880
the sacred chest of the old ages.

78
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,100
And who are you?

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,140
I'm ... Poke.

80
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,600
You're a "Poke"?

81
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,580
I've never heard of a "Poke."

82
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,890
What's a "Poke"?

83
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,170
I'm Poke!

84
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,990
I am the "dick" in "ridiculous"!

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,870
You are the what in the what?

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,510
Ah, forget about it.

87
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,100
So you're the fucking carriers of
the fucking something.

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,200
So ... what the heck are you doing?

89
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,190
We are carrying the sacred chest
of the old ages.

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,790
Isn't that obvoius?

91
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,140
Okay, I can see that, but ...

92
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,370
What for?

93
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,820
Why are you running around
all the time?

94
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,190
Mh ... could it be to make sure ...

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
that nobody gets the chest?

96
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,020
Okay ...?

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,390
But wouldn't it be easier to simply ...

98
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,940
guard the chest? I mean,
without moving.

99
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,500
No, what a foolish idea!

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,690
Everybody knows, guards can be
overwhelmed!

101
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,530
Well then, what about
locking it away?

102
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,830
In a crypta, or in a vault
or something.

103
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,940
Now, that would be an even
more foolish idea!

104
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,720
Everybody knows, locks
can be broken!

105
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,530
Well ... are you sure you still
got all marbles ...

106
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,040
Listen, we've been doing this
for two thousand years.

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,820
Do you really think we never
thought about all this?

108
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,020
Okay, I'll explain it to you.

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,980
Let's pretend we made all the effort
of putting up guards ...

110
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,860
and walls and locks and
traps and stuff.

111
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,440
This takes ages!

112
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,640
And now, some adventurer
comes along ...

113
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,080
Tricks the guards, breaks the locks ...

114
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,360
and defeats the traps.

115
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,070
And in the end, the only option
you're left with ...

116
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,510
is grabbing the artifact and
run away as fast as you can.

117
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,330
Now, if running away
is your only option ...

118
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,900
what was the point in setting up
all these barriers ...

119
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,750
in the first place?

120
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,380
Uh ... yes.

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,140
So the high council of ooga-booga
has decided to save our energy ...

122
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,350
for the really important matters.

123
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,040
We skipped the whole effort and
just started running from the start.

124
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,340
And we've proudly been doing so ...

125
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,140
for two thousand years.

126
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,650
It's the most efficient way to
protect the artifact.

127
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,770
End of discussion.

128
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,410
Okay. What's inside this chest that ...

129
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,190
makes it worth running to and fro ...

130
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,880
for like two thousand years?

131
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,750
And what's that pounding noise?

132
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,190
Err ... We don't know exactly.

133
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,130
All we do know is, that it must
be a very mighty artifact.

134
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,370
And ... well ...

135
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,270
that it obviously makes
very strange noises.

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,050
The high priest gave it to us
to make sure that ...

137
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,620
only the chosen ones may get
hold of it.

138
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,160
And what's your job in this affair?

139
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,860
I am the apprentice of the
honorable chest carriers.

140
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,550
Once I'll be grown up ...

141
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,220
I'm going to be a chest carrier, too!

142
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,560
But before I can become one ...

143
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,730
I have to complete a highly
sophisticated ...

144
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,420
and challenging two year
training program.

145
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,570
And what kind of
highly sophisticated training ...

146
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,710
is that?

147
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,160
What do you have to do?

148
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,350
Well ...

149
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,340
I've got to run after them and bring
them water when they're thirsty.

150
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,130
That's all?

151
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,430
That's the ooga-booga university?

152
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,710
Hey wait. this is not as easy
as it seems.

153
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,160
Being a chest carrier requires
highly trained skills.

154
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,150
It's very hard to run at precicely
the right speed, you know.

155
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,220
If you go to slow, someone could ...

156
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,370
catch up with you
and steal the artifact.

157
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,080
Yes, and running too fast will
make you pass out.

158
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,150
Well, no.
That's actually not the problem.

159
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,690
The catch is, you've got
to stay below the speed limit.

160
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,230
Err ... what?

161
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,190
There's a speed limit? I mean ...
in the jungle?

162
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,000
Hey, think about it!

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is the brazilian rainforest.

164
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,920
If everyone was allowed to
go as fast as they wanted ...

165
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,820
there wouldn't be a single tree left!

166
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,670
Uh oh ... there goes another one.

167
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,160
Ah, one day, I'll be one of the
honorable chest carriers.

168
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,800
Running through the forest,
swiftly like the wind ...

169
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,580
Listening to the birds,
and the pounding in my chest.

170
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,050
Always remember the lines
from the book!

171
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,790
"I hear a pound pound
pounding in my chest."

172
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,370
Uh ... Wait wait wait wait
wait a minute!

173
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,120
That sound coming from that
box ... I mean ...

174
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,360
How should I say ...

175
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,540
I think I need that artifact.

176
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,850
Heh, yeah, sure!

177
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,340
But only the chosen ones may
approach the chest.

178
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,180
And how can you tell that someone
is the chosen one?

179
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,110
We don't know.
We're supposed to recognize them ...

180
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,490
when they come.

181
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,200
Here I am! I must get the chest!

182
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,270
But you can't. You don't look
like a chosen one.

183
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,280
Okay, so let's pretend
I'm not the chosen one.

184
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,370
Would there be any other way
to get the artifact?

185
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,150
Maybe. Maybe not.

186
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,890
Ah come on! You can tell me.

187
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,370
Everything will be cool!
I can keep a secret.

188
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,150
Well, I probably could tell you ...

189
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,190
if there is a way to get the
artifact, but ...

190
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,290
There is no such thing as a free lunch
if you know what I mean.

191
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,370
Okay, I'll bite.
What do I have to do?

192
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,970
The carriers are thirsty, and it's my
duty to bring them water.

193
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,230
But I'm feeling pretty
exhausted, you know.

194
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,560
And I thought, maybe you
could give me a hand.

195
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,020
All you've got to do is to take
this bottle of water ...

196
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,750
and run after them, so they can
have something to drink.

197
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,540
Alright, and then you'll tell me
if there is a way ...

198
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,520
for me to get hold of the artifact.

199
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,320
Well, fair enough.

200
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,780
That sounds easy. Gimme that bottle.

201
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,990
Hey wait! Guys, guys!

202
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,120
I got water for you!

203
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,310
I said wait!

204
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,430
My ... gosh ...

205
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,230
Man ...

206
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,930
That was more exhausting than
being the guest of honor ...

207
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,830
on a rabbit swinger party.

208
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,840
I told you it's harder than it looks.

209
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,400
Okay.

210
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,710
I carried the water for you ...

211
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,820
now you must tell me if there is a
way for me to get hold of the artifact.

212
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,050
Yes, you're right.

213
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,910
Now I can tell you.

214
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,080
There is no way to get hold
of the artifact.

215
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,640
What?

216
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,130
But you promised!

217
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,180
Yes, I promised to tell you
if there is a way.

218
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,890
And there is no way. I told you,
just like I promised.

219
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,160
What?

220
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,610
And I just found something
out about you.

221
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,720
You are precicely as dumb as you look.

222
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,340
Thanks for doing my work, ferret!

223
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,060
What ... Maybe I look dumb ...

224
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,820
But you can't imagine how you are
gonna look after I broke your nose!

225
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,500
I was fast enough to catch up
with your ooga-boogas ...

226
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,000
and I'm certainly fast enough to
catch up with you, too!

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,070
Well ... catch me if you can!

228
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,750
Hey!

229
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,640
When I catch you I'll stick your ...
bloody artifact up your god-damn arse!

230
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,140
What was that?

231
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,460
A speed trap?

232
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,280
In the middle of the jungle!

233
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,990
What the fuck?

234
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,520
I think I'm blind!

235
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,890
Uh, who, me?

236
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,490
Uh, how much?
You guys must be joking!

237
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,110
But ...

238
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,480
I don't have any money.

239
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,350
I just fell out of a plane.

240
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,290
And I don't have anything except ...

241
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,450
for my big bottle of arabian mocha.

242
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,050
So, now what?

243
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,880
Ouch ...

244
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,280
Ah, I get it!
You guys want my parachute!

245
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,570
Para-Choot. Gah!

246
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,640
Okay ...

247
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,410
Let me just fetch it for you.

248
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,450
It's pretty messed up, but ...

249
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,830
here it is!

250
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,920
If it makes you happy.

251
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,680
Have fun with the parachute!

252
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,270
I can't believe that this
little sucker escaped.

253
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,750
If I ever meet that guy again ...

254
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,220
This is getting worse and worse.

255
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,690
Ah, well. At least I was lucky.

256
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,480
They took my parachute
and not my precious coffee.

257
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,560
"There's an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil!"

258
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,490
Suddenly everything is so clear!

259
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,450
Now I understand everything!

260
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,490
My brain! It works!

261
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,750
I can think!

262
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,250
The powers of caffeine! I ... I ...

263
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,850
Oh, shit ...

264
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,890
It's over ... but ...

265
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,290
Hey! I got an idea!

266
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,090
Now I know, how to get to the chest!

267
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,980
I will prove those guys, that I ...

268
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,110
look much dumber than I really am!

269
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,480
Hello? Hello?

270
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,520
Are you thirsty again?
I got something for you!

271
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,260
Oogey-Boogey!

272
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,530
Hello?

273
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,530
Is everybody gone?

274
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,220
Ah ... Let's see, what we have here.

275
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,490
Oh ... wow!

276
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,310
Shiny thing!

277
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,470
Wow, cool!

278
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,300
This is what we've been looking for?

279
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,380
It's round, and flashy, and shiny ...

280
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,510
and ...

281
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,780
And it's beautiful!

282
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,540
And it's mine!

283
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,520
Nobody shall have it!

284
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,190
It's mine, mine alone!

285
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,120
My motherfucking precious!

286
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,000
I must not let them have it!

287
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,730
Whoa!

288
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,010
Wow!

289
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,950
Caffeine flashback!

290
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,150
Alright, Lionel! Here I come!

291
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,180
Never underestimate the power
of arabian mocha!

292
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,020
Poke wins, carrier lost! Yay!

293
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,490
"That's the way - I like it!"

294
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,030
"That's the way - I like it!"

295
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,540
Ow! Shit!

296
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,930
I don't understand ...

297
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,020
Why don't they open the gates?

298
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,310
I feel they have the key ...

299
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,820
but don't they know how to
open the gates?

300
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,210
Has the key fallen into the
wrong hands?

301
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,820
Or has the knowledge of the
ritual been lost?

302
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,260
Am I doomed to stay here forever?

303
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,140
I can feel the darkness
growing stronger.

304
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,500
I must do something but ...

305
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,160
my hands are bound.

306
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,220
This place is like a golden cage.

307
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,140
While it protects me from
all that is dark ...

308
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,010
it bars me from fighting
the darkness outside.

309
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,330
Oh Gods ...

310
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,870
Please let them remember
how to use the key.

311
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,300
Let them remember
the ancient words ...

312
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,410
to set me free.

313
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,100
Alright ...

314
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,240
Now you've arrested us ...

315
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,030
What's going to happen next?

316
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,370
Are you just going to let us
rot in here?

317
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,680
Ah, shut up!

318
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,190
The mighty producer is on his way.

319
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,710
He wants to talk to you.

320
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,160
You'll live at least as long ...

321
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,630
as it takes for him to arrive.

322
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,970
So, enjoy your lives while they last.

323
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,350
Yup, enjoy yourselves.

324
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,660
Who the heck is the producer?

325
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,620
And what makes im mighty?

326
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,500
Oh, you naive little thing!

327
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,780
Don't you know what a producer is?

328
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,670
Who do you think writes all the ...

329
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,780
high-scoring top-ten chart-breakers?

330
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,780
The musicians themselves?

331
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,580
Those are just puppets.

332
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,120
Barely intelligent enough
to hold a microphone.

333
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,430
The producer is the one who
draws the strings ...

334
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,770
making them dance.

335
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,280
Without the producer ...

336
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,250
there would be no music.

337
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,540
Yup, no music at all.

338
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,390
But that's complete bullshit!

339
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,900
Every talented person can write music.

340
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,350
I must know.

341
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,670
My father was both ...

342
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,580
a singer and a songwriter.

343
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,170
You don't expect me to
believe that, do you?

344
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,550
I know that is completely impossible.

345
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:09,090
No producer, no music.

346
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,520
Now, silence!

347
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,860
There he comes!

348
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
Ladies and gentlemen:

349
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,090
The Producer!

350
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,680
At your service, oh mighty Producer!

351
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,140
Lionel Cristopher Scruffycat.

352
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,460
So we meet at last.

353
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,640
I must say ...

354
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,250
You have a striking similarity
to your father.

355
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,020
You knew my father?

356
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,130
Yes, I did.

357
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,700
I wasn't always a producer, you know.

358
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,700
Many, many years ago ...

359
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,470
your father and I ...

360
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,350
used to be good friends.

361
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,310
He was an aspiring musician.

362
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,770
And I used to be a talent scout
for the record company ...

363
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,140
that was publishing him.

364
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,600
At first everything worked out fine.

365
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,840
Your father was a pretty
successful musician.

366
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,330
Later ...

367
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,390
when I eventually got promoted ...

368
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,220
they gave me the chance
to name a successor.

369
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,190
And I thought ...

370
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,590
your father might be a good choice.

371
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,200
So he got the offer ...

372
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,940
and gladly accepted.

373
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,820
But ...

374
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,780
But then ... what happened then?

375
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,320
Well ...

376
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,830
It seems your father had a few ...

377
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,600
misconceptions about the duties
of a talent scout.

378
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,990
You know ...

379
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,910
Many people think that ...

380
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,330
record companies send out
talent scouts ...

381
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,000
in order to search for
talented people ...

382
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,130
in the hope of discovering
the stars of tomorrow.

383
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,480
But when your father was clued in
on the real mission ...

384
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,340
he was supposed to fulfill ...

385
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,380
Mmh, how should I say ...

386
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,750
he suddenly began losing his ...

387
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,550
enthusiasm.

388
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,160
Or in other words,
he threw his carreer.

389
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,280
What was so horrible
about his new job ...

390
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,450
that he absolutely couln't tolerate?

391
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,660
There is a secret ...

392
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,090
that is well-kept from people outside
the corporation.

393
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,530
I'm not supposed to tell you either.

394
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,760
But you're not going to live
to tell anybody.

395
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,590
The inspiration behind all music
does not come out of thin air.

396
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,280
There are actual ...

397
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,180
physical sources of inspiration.

398
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,380
From them inspiration
used to flow freely ...

399
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,210
equally enlightening all of
the people ...

400
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,340
across the lands.

401
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,960
Now, seen from a
business perspective ...

402
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,720
this is not exactly the ideal.

403
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,300
How are you supposed
to sell something ...

404
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,880
which is a resource free for all ...

405
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,340
like te air you breathe?

406
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,060
That's where our talent scouts come in.

407
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,710
They used to be the ones searching ...

408
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,980
and finding these sources
of inspiration ...

409
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,280
and bringing them under our control!

410
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,650
Your father was horrified
by the very idea.

411
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,920
He didn't like the concept of
running short inspiration ...

412
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,470
To artificially increase the value
of our products.

413
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,610
Mh ... I can relate to that.

414
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,180
At one time ...

415
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,820
we thought we had all sources
of inspiration ...

416
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,250
under our control.

417
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,620
Talent scrouts were no longer needed.

418
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,280
However ...

419
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,960
your father believed that there was ...

420
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,800
one more source of inspiration ...

421
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,820
that we had failed to discover.

422
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,500
He was determined to find it
and make sure ...

423
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,710
that we would never gain
control over it.

424
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,470
At first we didn't pay much
attention to him.

425
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,120
We thought he was just a ranting ...

426
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,100
disgruntled ex-employee.

427
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,900
However ...

428
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,790
we were smart enough to
keep his research activities ...

429
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,170
under close supervision.

430
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,500
He knew that, of course.

431
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,020
He never let anything slip.

432
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,300
Until now!

433
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,980
In a way, I have to thank you.

434
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,480
Without you, I would never
have been able ...

435
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,890
to decode the riddles
in your fathers journal.

436
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,070
Now we know that there is indeed ...

437
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,050
one last source of inspiration ...

438
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,160
hidden within the walls of the
long forgotten ...

439
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,660
Temple of Dunnowhat!

440
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,610
And in just a few hours ...

441
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,870
it will be mine!

442
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,690
You!

443
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,160
You are such a piece of ...

444
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,350
You ...

445
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,180
I'm speechless!

446
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,370
And what's going to happen
with us now?

447
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,500
You know ...

448
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,160
I really hate to get my paws dirty.

449
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,140
I tink I'll just leave you here.

450
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,380
And soon ...

451
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,160
nothing will be left of you but ...

452
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,200
a bunch of nameless
rotting skeletons ...

453
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,300
in the middle of the
brazilian rainforest.

454
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,250
And nobody will ever find you!

455
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,210
I must go now and
prepare the ceremony.

456
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,950
Have a nice death!

457
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,480
Oh come back you coward!

458
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,230
You slimy rotten scoundrel!

459
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,250
Come back and fight like a-

460
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,030
Mika! Mika stop!

461
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,160
You know this is not going to
get you anywhere.

462
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,380
And remember, there is still hope!

463
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,120
Poke is still out there.

464
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,980
You're honestly putting
your faith in Poke?

465
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,030
I don't know ...

466
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,410
I think, the only thing
Poke would be capable of ...

467
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,860
is making things considerably worse.

468
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,480
Think of it.

469
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,180
Following our tracks
and showing up here ...

470
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,420
would be about the
most stupid thing ...

471
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,860
he possibly could do.

472
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,800
because, when he comes here-

473
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,300
Ta da!

474
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,580
Poke to the rescue!

475
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,520
Time to surrender!
You have no chance!

476
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,460
I got the green belt in take-one-leap!

477
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,580
Boot to the head!

478
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,480
Ow!

479
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,420
Ow ...

480
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,740
What the hell is this?

481
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,110
Do you know this guy?

482
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,210
This must have been the ...

483
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,330
the most stupid rescue attempt ...

484
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,670
I've ever witnessed!

485
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,160
Oh Poke, you idiot!

486
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,030
You ruined everything!

487
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,890
You've been our last hope!

488
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,090
Alright!

489
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,890
You wanted to meet your friends?

490
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,950
No problem There's enough
space in the cage ...

491
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,060
for all of you.

492
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,760
Yup, lots of space.

493
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,710
Hey, let me go! I'm not an idiot!

494
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,310
Yes, you are.

495
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,410
No, I'm not!

496
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,270
At least not compared to
these two boneheads.

497
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,400
Hey, buddy ...

498
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,830
You obvously don't know
what you're saying.

499
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:43,690
We're captains of the mighty
Producer's personal guard.

500
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,380
We are members of the
international elite!

501
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,480
Yup, elite!

502
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,020
I believe it when I see it!

503
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,860
I'm much smarter than you are!

504
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,360
And I can prove it! Come on!

505
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,640
Challenge me! Give me a puzzle
or something.

506
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,150
Hey, do you know the riddle
with the shepherd ...

507
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,630
the sheep, the cabbage and the wolf?

508
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,050
No, never heard of it.

509
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,030
Oh, very good!

510
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,730
I mean ... may I explain it to you?

511
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,540
Fire away.

512
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,120
Well ... There is a man with a boat ...

513
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,810
who must move a wolf ...

514
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,770
a sheep ...

515
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,420
and a box of cabbage
to the other side of the river.

516
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,780
But there is a catch.

517
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,650
The boat is very small ...

518
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,720
So the poor guy can always ...

519
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,420
only take one thing with him.

520
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,840
And now his problem is that ...

521
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,050
when he leaves the wolf
and the sheep alone ...

522
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,770
the wolf will eat the sheep.

523
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,530
When he leaves the sheep and
the cabbage alone ...

524
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,380
the sheep will eat the cabbage.

525
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,280
So, what does he have to do ...

526
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,120
in order to get all three things ...

527
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,620
safely to the other side?

528
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,490
Ha! That's easy! That's easy.

529
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,930
Okay, ferret guy! You're toast!

530
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,210
Yup, toast!

531
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,480
Alright!

532
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,550
Then let the contest begin!

533
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,250
Poke, the ferret, starts!

534
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,470
Alright, he's not going to solve
it anyway.

535
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,360
Hey! Okie-dokie! Let's see ...

536
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,400
Just a second ...

537
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,360
Alright, let's see ...

538
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,520
Uh, first he moves the cabbage
to the other side ...

539
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,810
And then ... no, wait ...

540
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,520
Then the sheep will be fucked.

541
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,150
So then he has to
move the wolf first ...

542
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,440
Oh, come on, come on,
you're so stupid!

543
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,850
If he moves the wolf first ...

544
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,560
he will leave the sheep
and the cabbage behind ...

545
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
and the sheep will eat the cabbage!

546
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,770
Don't you get it?

547
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,010
No no no, wait, wait!

548
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,460
I just need a little visualisation.

549
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,500
So, let's pretend that ...

550
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,600
you are the sheep ...

551
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,990
and you are the wolf.

552
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,850
Yup, the wolf.

553
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,510
And I am the cabbage.

554
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,010
Okay, now ... what?

555
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,100
Okay ...

556
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,760
Let's pretend ...

557
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,930
this bridge is the river.

558
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,400
Of course ...

559
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,080
the first thing, you have to do ...

560
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,560
Is taking the sheep over
to the other side.

561
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,700
Watch me, I'm the sheep!

562
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,600
Baaaah!

563
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,370
Then, the shepherd gets the wolf
over the river.

564
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,490
That's you!

565
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,050
Yup, that's me!

566
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,160
- And now ...
- Arooo!

567
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,770
And now ... uh ...

568
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,540
The shepherd sends the sheep back ...

569
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,300
over the river,
because the wolf is here.

570
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,950
Baaaah!

571
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,380
Wait ... wait, wait ...

572
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,900
This didn't get us anywhere, did it?

573
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,430
And besides, it's my turn!
You messed it up, and I ...

574
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,720
have to start all over again!

575
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,290
Now, let's pretend, you ...

576
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,120
are the cabbage ...

577
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,630
and I'm the shepherd.

578
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,690
Now I, the shepherd, take you, the
cabbage, over the river.

579
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,520
Good, and now I'll go back to
pick up the sheep.

580
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,290
There is no sheep. You forgot
to say who is the sheep.

581
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,440
What? Uh, shit!

582
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,870
Okay, give me one
final chance, alright?

583
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,870
Okay, but this will be
really the last chance, buddy.

584
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,080
Okay, I'll make sure not to forget
anybody this time.

585
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,240
I'm the shepherd ...

586
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,590
Mika is the cabbage ...

587
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,670
Lionel is the wolf and ...

588
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,920
Lori is the sheep!

589
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,140
Of course.

590
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,070
Hey!

591
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,700
Wait ... Wait, wait, wait!
Now I got it!

592
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,760
Now I got it!

593
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,710
Hey, it's still my turn!

594
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,080
Oh, Poke. Come on!

595
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,520
Don't be a spoilsport!

596
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,220
If he wants to solve it ...

597
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,560
why don't you let him?

598
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,350
Well, if I have to ... Go ahead!

599
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,630
Okay, okay! Step one:

600
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,150
The shepherd takes the
sheep over the river.

601
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,470
Alright, I'm the shepherd,
I'll do everything you say.

602
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,330
So ... Step two:

603
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,660
The shepherd goes back and takes
the cabbage over the river.

604
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,150
Okay, your wish is my command.

605
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,390
Now!

606
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,890
Now comes the trick!

607
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,690
Step three:

608
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,500
He takes the sheep back with him ...

609
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,640
so it won't eat the cabbage!

610
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,080
Smart move! You're good!

611
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,140
- Keep going!
- Yeah!

612
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,160
Step four:

613
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,210
Now the shepherd takes the wolf ...

614
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,620
and brings it over the river,
leaving the sheep behind.

615
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,300
Excellent!
I think you're on the right track!

616
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,020
Yup!

617
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,150
And finally, step five:

618
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,460
He goes back and brings the sheep
over the river.

619
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,030
And that's it!

620
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,060
I solved it!

621
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,700
Yeah!

622
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,070
You're so good!

623
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,850
You really beat me! Good job!
Keep going!

624
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,180
Yeah, was fun!

625
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,880
I'd really love to hang out
some more with you ...

626
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,440
but it's getting late ...

627
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,220
and we really have to go now.

628
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,540
I hope we'll see each other again!

629
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,270
Bye!

630
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,590
- Bye!
- Bye!

631
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:16,810
Thanks for stopping by!

632
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,780
See you, guys!

633
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,750
Woo-hoo!

634
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,670
We're the smartest guards in the
whole wide world!

635
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,950
Yup, we are! We truly are!

636
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,460
Man, that was exhausting.

637
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,620
It's time for a nice hot cup
of brazilian coffee.

638
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,210
- Make that two!
- Sure! I'll bring you one.

639
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,270
"They've got an awful lot of
coffee in Braz-"

640
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,880
Oops ...

641
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,890
Are you sure this is the way they went?

642
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,980
Yes. I've been following their tracks.

643
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,020
And they are leading right this way.

644
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,400
We could at least have taken ...

645
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,950
one of the torches with us.

646
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,410
It's so dark!

647
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,830
I can't see anything.

648
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,180
Ah, don't worry.

649
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,200
I'm a cat!

650
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,600
A feline nose is one of
the most sensitive things on earth.

651
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,440
I can smell our enemies clearly.

652
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,320
And as long as I don't
lose the track ...

653
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,410
we will find them.

654
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,600
Trust me.

655
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,340
What a relief!

656
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,270
Poke, that wasn't necessary.

657
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,150
Mika, lead on.
Where do we have to go?

658
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,080
I don't know, I lost my sense of smell.

659
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,460
Okay, so that's what you get ...

660
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,500
when you let a girl navigate.

661
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,340
Step aside and let a man handle this.

662
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,660
All we have to do is follow trhe wind,
because ...

663
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,590
If there is wind
coming from a tunnel ...

664
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,690
There must be an exit
on the other side.

665
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,210
I saw this on television.

666
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,210
You mean, we have to go ...

667
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,970
chase your fart?

668
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,920
Don't be so cynical.

669
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,410
Poke's right, for a change.

670
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,510
Yes, I am! Now, follow me!

671
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,660
That's strange.

672
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,310
This tunnel has a metal floor.

673
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,930
Yeah, and it's getting steeper
and steeper.

674
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,530
Uh oh ...

675
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,860
I think, I know what's going on ...

676
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,030
What is it, Lori?

677
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,260
I think ... I think, we're on a slide!

678
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,610
Aaaah!

679
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,790
Ow!

680
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,580
- Ah!
- Ow!

681
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,520
Ah ... Is everyone alright?

682
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,300
Oh ... I'm here!

683
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,460
I'm here.

684
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,350
Uh ... I wonder where
the slide dumped us.

685
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,340
I don't know, but ...

686
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,220
It feels like we're still moving.

687
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,390
No!

688
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,120
- No!
- Aaah!

689
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,080
Aaah!

690
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,950
Fuck!

691
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,340
We're going way to fast!

692
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,170
Everybody hold on tight!
There's a left turn coming up!

693
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,280
Aaah!

694
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,460
So this is what you get
when you let a guy navigate?

695
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,410
Hey!

696
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,800
And he always calls me a bad driver!

697
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,740
Hey!

698
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,390
Right turn!

699
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,750
Aaah!

700
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,400
Does anybody know where the heck
we are going?

701
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,490
We are going to die!

702
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,480
Hey, stop complaining!

703
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,610
We're going to die in the name of
Lionel's father!

704
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,340
We should be proud of ourselves,
shouldn't we, Lionel?

705
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,950
Oh, be careful what you say!

706
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,570
We didn't force you to come with us!

707
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,990
Feel free to jump if you want to.

708
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,770
Oh, shut up you two!
This is neither the right place ...

709
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,620
nor the right time for discussion.

710
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,330
No! I kept my mouth shut long enough!

711
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,950
This is precicely the right time
for discussion!

712
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,920
Lionel!

713
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,260
I need to have a word with you ...

714
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,850
about you and your father.

715
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,710
It can't go on like this!

716
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,750
It is very important that you finally-

717
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,880
It's going down!

718
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,220
Aaah!

719
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,870
Get off me!

720
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,660
Oh, I can't believe that grown-up
men can be such cowards!

721
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,360
Uh ... where was I?

722
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,030
Ah, yes!

723
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,280
Lionel ... Lionel I-

724
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,700
Mika, I really appreciate your
involvement, but ...

725
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,150
uh ... in case you haven't noticed ...

726
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,670
we're in a runaway lorry ...

727
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,590
going steeply downhill!

728
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,300
Yes, and so this may be
the last chance!

729
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,510
No! No, I don't want to die!

730
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,930
Lori ...

731
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,480
Lori, we are not going to die, okay?

732
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,900
Okay ...

733
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,780
Lionel, listen to me!

734
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,300
We all know you made mistakes
in the past ...

735
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,320
But sometimes you just have to ...

736
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,410
put your past behind you.

737
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,260
We're going all the way
with you here ...

738
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,740
and something is really-

739
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,360
Hey look! I see a light ...

740
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,790
at the end of the tunnel!

741
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,960
Uh, what?

742
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,780
Yes, I see it, too! We're saved!

743
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,020
Uh, wait ...

744
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,500
It's coming closer!

745
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,510
Yes, it's coming closer way to fast!

746
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,620
That's not the exit!

747
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,310
It's a train!

748
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,610
Aaah!

749
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,490
Oh, my gosh!

750
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,960
That was close!

751
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,220
That was too close!

752
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,180
Mika, I'm sorry but I completely ...

753
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,240
forgot what you were about to say.

754
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,080
You wanted to tell me something
about my father.

755
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,130
Now, tell me. I'm listening.

756
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,870
Alright. I said ...

757
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,200
We all know you made
mistakes in the past.

758
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,150
Hey!

759
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,440
Come on, get to the point!

760
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,150
I was just about getting to the point!

761
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,330
Stop shouting!

762
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,110
I'm not shouting, I'm screaming!

763
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,160
For heaven's sake, just tell me
what you want to say ...

764
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,780
preferably before we all die!

765
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,760
Okay, Lionel!

766
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,030
I just wanted to say that ...

767
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,270
I know that you made
mistakes in the past.

768
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,760
But you can't go on like this, if ...

769
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,890
- Aaah!
-Aaah!

770
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,350
Aaah!

771
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,910
Lori! Hold on!

772
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,030
Welcome to the "Runaway Lorry"
thrill ride!

773
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,500
Please keep your paws, feet and
tail inside the vehicle ...

774
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,530
at all times!

775
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,710
That's not funny! Help me!

776
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,220
Hold on!

777
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,930
We must get the two halves
together again!

778
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,470
Sure! But how?

779
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,660
Grab Lori's tail!

780
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,470
Okay!

781
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,670
I will grab her paws!

782
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,250
Now pull!

783
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,970
No! Don't pull! No!

784
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,240
Okay!

785
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,320
One ... two ... three!

786
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,460
Aaah!

787
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,800
Lori?

788
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,290
Are you alright?

789
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,780
I'll live ...

790
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,390
... barely.

791
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,080
I guess I will never have to
wear high heels anymore.

792
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,370
Alright ...

793
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,730
Now, before anything else
gets in the way.

794
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,750
Lionel ... it can't go on like this!

795
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,950
We've been going all the
way with you ...

796
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,960
and something is very
obvious about ...

797
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,440
the relationship between
you and your father.

798
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,960
But you have to realize ...

799
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,500
that it is over now.

800
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,630
Let me tell you something about
when I was little.

801
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,420
My mother had to work all day ...

802
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,750
so I was home alone all the time.

803
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,310
And whenever I-

804
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,250
We're under fire!

805
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,720
Pirates!

806
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,970
Aaah!

807
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,330
They're going to kill us!

808
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,360
No! They are not going to kill us!

809
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,940
Return fire!

810
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,490
Aye aye, Captain!

811
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,890
Fire!

812
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,720
Aaah!

813
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,440
Too short!

814
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,070
Okay, okay. That was close!
Aim higher!

815
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,620
Aye aye, Captain!

816
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,300
And ... fire again!

817
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,710
Woo! Full hit!

818
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,250
Guys?

819
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,920
- Guys!
- Woo-hoo! We did it!

820
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,390
- Guys!
- What?

821
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:12,130
Are you all nuts?

822
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,050
I don't care about your discussions.

823
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,620
We've got to stop this thing!

824
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,490
Ah ... stop this thing!

825
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,850
What a brilliant idea!
And how are we gonna do that?

826
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,720
If you don't want to try, I will try!

827
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,170
I've got a licence!

828
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,600
Do you think, because I'm a girl
I'm too dumb to drive?

829
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,500
- Be my guest!
- Let me get to the front here.

830
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:34,810
Okay ... It's been a while ...

831
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,240
Let's see ... where are the brakes?

832
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,950
Ah! This must be the brakes.

833
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,600
No, no! Okay, okay ...

834
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,690
Wait a minute ... wait a minute.
This one here!

835
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,410
Oh no! We're doomed!

836
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,890
Okay ... Okay, okay!
One more try, okay? Okay?

837
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,590
Okay ...

838
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,000
Welcome to "Traffic Professional"
navigation system!

839
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,990
Please wait while loading!

840
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,870
Please wait while loading!

841
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,130
Locating vehicle.

842
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,070
Locating vehicle.

843
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,960
Destination found.

844
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,650
The Temple of Dunnowhat.

845
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,910
Distance to destination:

846
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,650
One kilometer.

847
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,630
Hey, that's pretty cool!

848
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,500
We've been on the right track
all along!

849
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,530
I knew it!

850
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,750
I knew I could do the right thing!

851
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,240
Distance to destination:

852
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,100
Five hundred meters.

853
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:45,470
Uh Lori? Don't you think we're
going pretty fast?

854
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,970
Hey, the faster we go,
the sooner we'll be there.

855
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,100
Distance to destination:

856
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,890
Three hundred meters.

857
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,270
Uh, Lionel? Did your father mention
this in his book?

858
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,490
Uh ... If he did I obviously
didn't get the clue, because ...

859
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,690
I don't remember.

860
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,940
Distance to destination:

861
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,490
Two hundred meters.

862
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,710
Yay! We're almost there!

863
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,890
Dunnowhat, here we come!

864
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,590
Guys, I've got a very bad
feeling about this ...

865
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,660
Warning! Warning!

866
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,850
End of tracks in one hundred meters!

867
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,970
Warning!

868
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:19,740
- What?
- What?

869
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,910
- Aaah!
- No!

870
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,540
- Ow!
- Uh!

871
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,800
Ouch!

872
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,830
Okay ... We have arrived.

873
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,370
You have reached your destination.

874
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,480
Thank you for using "Traffic Pro".

875
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,770
Congratulations.

876
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,070
Is everyone alive?

877
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,800
Okay, I think I need a
moment to recover.

878
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,020
Uh, Mika? Didn't you want to
tell me something?

879
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,420
Now is the chance.

880
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,090
Did I?

881
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,240
Uh ... never mind.

882
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,350
Look! We found it!

883
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,590
This must be the entrance to
the Temple of Dunnowhat.

884
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,420
Ah, yes indeed!

885
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,770
I remember the drawing in the diary.

886
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,850
So, this is our goal, but ...

887
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,210
but what are we supposed to do here?

888
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,640
How about ...

889
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,160
going inside?

890
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,360
In ... side?

891
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:48,190
Uh, no. Actually, we got chased around
the world by the music gestapo,

892
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,940
kicked out of a plane,

893
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,410
run over by rolling stones ...

894
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,660
and nearly eaten by voodoo people
just to turn around and go home.

895
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,830
Not!

896
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,920
You can jump into a lake if you want to
but I'll go with Lionel.

897
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,080
And so will I.

898
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,160
But ... that's not what I-

899
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,470
You don't have to come
if you don't want to, Lori.

900
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,520
This is something between
my father and me.

901
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,090
Oh, no way!

902
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,770
We will stick with you until the end.

903
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,000
Won't we?

904
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:11,990
Yeah.

905
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,670
Let's go and kick some ass!

906
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,810
Come on, Lori!

907
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,230
O-okay. Let's go.

908
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,910
Lionel! You go first!

909
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:24,010
I don't think it's a good idea ...

910
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,650
to just walk inside.

911
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,070
Don't forget, we're
hopelessly outnumbered.

912
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:29,480
Wait here ...

913
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,820
If I go alone, maybe they
won't notice me.

914
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,650
I'll take a look around the corner
and check on the situation.

915
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,040
My dear comrades!

916
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,340
The time has come!

917
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,130
History is about to be made!

918
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,340
From this day on there will be ...

919
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,620
no other producers than us!

920
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,660
With all sources of inspiration ...

921
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,410
under our control ...

922
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,010
We will be able to control ...

923
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:06,800
all music on this planet!

924
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,870
Unlimited wealth!

925
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,100
Unprecedented increase in
shareholder value!

926
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,900
The ultimate return on investment!

927
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,140
Gentlemen!

928
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,420
Power up the amplifiers!

929
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,510
Let's start the show!

930
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,820
Ha ha ha!

931
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,070
Yes!

932
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,570
My Producer! It is done!

933
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,020
There's no inspiration left!

934
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,290
Yes!

935
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,200
Yes!

936
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,050
Very good!

937
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,770
Very, very good!

938
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,440
Now it's time to celebrate!

939
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,440
Ha ha ha!

940
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,370
Oh no!

941
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,040
- Oh no, it's too late!
- What?

942
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,420
What did ... what did you see?

943
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,200
The source of inspiration!

944
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,730
They destroyed it! We came too late!

945
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,830
Aw, shit!

946
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:32,880
Oh no!

947
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,690
Is there really nothing we can do?

948
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,300
We must stop them!

949
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,210
Oh, get out of my way!

950
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,350
Nobody messes with Mika!

951
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,080
I will walk right in there and ...

952
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,450
kick those guys' butts
into next Monday!

953
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,780
No, let me go! Let me go!

954
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,440
Mika! Mika! It's pointless!

955
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,390
Mika, it's pointless.

956
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,860
The source has already been
destroyed!

957
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,080
Don't tell me you're giving up.

958
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,820
You're the big thinker ...

959
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,840
so think of something, already!

960
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,660
If not for us, do it for your father.

961
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,630
Alright.

962
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,080
Alright.

963
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,760
Let's give it one last try.

964
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,200
Okay guys ...

965
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,950
What do we have?

966
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,960
Well ... well, we have the diary.

967
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:29,800
No Lori, I lost it when I
crashed into the forest. Sorry.

968
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,170
Uh, well ... then I guess ...

969
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,280
we don't have anything else.

970
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,540
Except ... except maybe ...

971
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,970
But I guess it doesn't mean anything.

972
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,210
Except for what?

973
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,320
What do you have?

974
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,090
Anything might be important!

975
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,470
Show it to us, Lori.

976
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,140
I found thois stone-egg in the
cavern in the jungle.

977
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,670
It seemed to be unimportant so
I didn't mention it.

978
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,480
Oh, what?

979
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,260
You found one of those, too?

980
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,780
I have another one.

981
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,520
It just looks the same!

982
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,030
But it makes a different sound.

983
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:31,970
Yeah.

984
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,840
Guys?

985
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,340
I think, I must tell you something.

986
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,700
Yes, Poke?

987
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,450
I ... well ... Look what I found!

988
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:51,830
Three of them!

989
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,770
This can't be a coincidence.

990
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,330
And each of them makes a
different sound.

991
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,470
Is this another puzzle?

992
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,700
Let's see what happens when ...

993
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,150
we let them play together.

994
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,520
Mh ... that's a good idea.

995
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,650
The tune sounds familiar to me ...

996
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:29,320
but ... where do I know it from?

997
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,900
It sounds really beautiful.

998
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,550
Yeah, sounds like the music of a
second class porn movie.

999
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,930
No, it does not!

1000
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,760
What? You watch porn?

1001
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,100
Oh ... well ...

1002
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:52,440
Lionel, do you know this melody?

1003
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:57,400
Mh ... It's nothing more than a faded
memory from long ago.

1004
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,710
It sounds like a song my father
used to sing to me ...

1005
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,150
when I was little.

1006
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,100
Your father used to sing
porn soundtracks?

1007
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:08,890
Ow!

1008
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,010
? ? ?

1009
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,660
Try to remember it,
it might be important.

1010
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,240
Well ... I think ...

1011
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:20,150
I think it went like this:

1012
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:29,620
"Let's call to battle
on a musicial scale."

1013
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,280
"Through song and through dance..."

1014
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,780
"The good will prevail!"

1015
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,910
What was that?

1016
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:38,930
I don't know ...

1017
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,000
Spooky ...

1018
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,330
Try it again! But this time,
keep singing!

1019
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,810
This is harder than you think,
I can barely remember the song.

1020
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:47,630
Try!

1021
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:55,910
"Let's call to a battle
on a musicial scale."

1022
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:01,020
"Through songs and through dance
the good will prevail!"

1023
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:06,380
"The power of music
in it's true form of art..."

1024
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:13,990
"Doesn't come in a package,
no it comes from the heart!"

1025
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,850
Free, at last! Whew!

1026
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:39,520
That was about time!

1027
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,320
What took you so long?

1028
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,390
Wait a minute ...

1029
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,620
You're not the high priest!

1030
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,010
And you!

1031
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,780
You're not the master of ceremonies!

1032
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,010
Yes, and you are not Santa Claus!

1033
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,800
Tell us something we don't know.

1034
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:03,290
You don't know, who I am?

1035
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,900
I've been alive since time began.

1036
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,900
Not beast, not God, and yet not man.

1037
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:14,170
I am the music and the dance!

1038
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,110
I'm the piper, who enchants!

1039
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,080
My name is Poke, my teeth are shiny!

1040
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:20,930
I tell all the girls they can kiss my-

1041
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,180
Poke!

1042
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,350
That is the strangest welcome
I've ever received.

1043
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,650
Times must have changed a lot more
than I thought.

1044
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:43,310
Alright.

1045
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,830
Let me put it ?sicintally?.

1046
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,070
My name is Heather ...

1047
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,510
and I am the spirit of inspiration.

1048
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,110
And ... by the Tritons!

1049
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,590
It's been ages since someone ...

1050
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,610
called me finally and
summoned me here.

1051
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,580
The last source of inspiration
has been destroyed ...

1052
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,200
five minutes ago. I was there.

1053
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,400
So tell me who you really are!

1054
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:12,160
Inspiration can never be destroyed!
It's ...

1055
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,080
It's one of the forces that
binds the universe together.

1056
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,490
You mean, like duct tape?

1057
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,220
What?

1058
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,650
What are you talking about?

1059
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,520
I really am the spirit of inspiration!

1060
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,390
How come you don't know me?

1061
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,610
How could the people survive
without inspiration?

1062
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,310
This ritual has been passed down
from generation to generation ...

1063
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:41,760
and you ... you have the three keys.

1064
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,140
and ... and you know the song to
open the gate to my dimension ...

1065
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,860
and now you tell me, you don't
know who I am?

1066
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,170
I'm sorry to say this but ... no.

1067
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:52,280
Who are you?

1068
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,530
I already told you!

1069
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,810
And I wish I knew what's going on.

1070
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,770
Have people forgotten about me?

1071
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:04,460
Long ago, they used to summon me ...

1072
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,840
every week!

1073
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,530
We used to sing and dance and ...

1074
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,400
and our hearts and minds would soar!

1075
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:13,500
Those were the days ...

1076
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:18,020
But then, the summonings became
fewer and fewer ...

1077
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,340
and eventually stopped altogether.

1078
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,430
I can't remember ...

1079
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:23,930
how long ...

1080
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,590
and for centuries I've waited ...

1081
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:28,650
lonely and restless so ...

1082
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:32,230
Finally, you called me!
This couldn't be a coincidence!

1083
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,790
Oh, well ...

1084
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,290
Getting together,
singing and dancing ...

1085
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,430
this has become rare, lately.

1086
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,790
Really? How so?

1087
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,100
Music is not free anymore.

1088
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,550
All the music there is is being
controled by the big corporations.

1089
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,300
They have the full power to decide ...

1090
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,050
what kind of music is made ...

1091
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,360
who may listen to it ...

1092
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,920
and what the price is.

1093
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:54,980
Yeah ...

1094
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,050
We even had to pay a licence fee ...

1095
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,670
to be allowed to sing
"Happy Birthday" ...

1096
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,390
for Lionel the other day.

1097
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,670
Lionel's father had discovered ...

1098
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,350
why those corporations could
become so powerful.

1099
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:09,170
Nobody knew that there were actual
sources of inspiration ...

1100
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:10,550
hidden all over the world,

1101
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,530
which all creative people in the world
were drawing from.

1102
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,990
The music corporations found
out about that ...

1103
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,750
and destroyed all of them.

1104
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,120
Except one ...

1105
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,430
which remained hidden.

1106
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:25,240
My father quit his musicial carreer
after he found out ...

1107
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,420
about this last source
of inspiration ...

1108
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,750
in order to save it.

1109
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,490
But he was too old to finish
what he started.

1110
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,140
He wrote down all hos findings
in his book ...

1111
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,750
encoded in a way only
I could decypher.

1112
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,490
We followed the lead,
but we came too late.

1113
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,330
The last source of inspiration was
destroyed before my eyes.

1114
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:46,350
Tell me ...

1115
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:50,000
What exactly was it that you saw?

1116
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,070
What did it look like?

1117
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,980
Well, it looked like a
sparkling fountain ...

1118
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,180
brilliantly glowing in a bright light.

1119
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,610
I see!

1120
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,610
There's really not much of the ancient
knowledge left, is there anymore?

1121
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,820
I'll tell you what you've seen.

1122
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,710
What you've seen ...

1123
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,300
is a fountain of inspiration.

1124
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,410
But where do you think that
inspiration comes from?

1125
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,480
Inspiration is like spring water, it's ...

1126
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:21,040
it's fresh and it's new and ...

1127
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,410
and even though it is
fresh and new it's ...

1128
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,240
it's not being produced by anything
or in any way ...

1129
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,300
Like spring water, it ...

1130
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,950
What you see as spring water ...

1131
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:37,060
actually just been the rain in the
hills that's come down and ...

1132
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,580
And inspiration is like
that spring water.

1133
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,140
It's a very part of yourself
and everyone else.

1134
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,080
What you saw being destroyed ...

1135
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,180
that's just merely an outlet.

1136
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,350
It's like the well.

1137
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,730
You know,
It's not where the water is made ...

1138
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,830
it's just a place where it surfaces.

1139
00:59:55,250 --> 01:00:00,120
I am the spirit that brings
inspiration to the surface.

1140
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,350
So, you are taking all bad ideas
that went down the toilet ...

1141
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,740
and turn them into
inspirational spring water?

1142
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:09,400
No ...

1143
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,660
I mean ... yes ...

1144
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:11,540
Uh, no!

1145
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,280
Is he always like this?

1146
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,380
So that means, there is still hope?

1147
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,500
And what about the bad guys?

1148
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,110
Yeah, there's still a bunch of
bad guys in the temple ...

1149
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,140
musically pissing into your fountain!

1150
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,080
What?

1151
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,390
Yes.

1152
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:29,610
It's the Producer and his minions.

1153
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:34,150
You mean, those are the people
who drained all my fountains?

1154
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,040
Yes, that's them.

1155
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,330
Alright!

1156
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,560
Now watch! Listen closely!

1157
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,710
I'm going to show you how to
deal with guys like this.

1158
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,380
Hey you! Fancy-Pants Producer!

1159
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:02,500
What are you doing in my temple?

1160
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,230
Who are you?

1161
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,750
I am the owner of this fountain ...

1162
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:13,380
and I don't tolerate any unwanted
guests in here.

1163
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:14,420
Now ...

1164
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,100
The fountains of inspiration
will be refilled ...

1165
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,090
and music will be free again!

1166
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:21,410
No! Never!

1167
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:24,050
I've worked all my life to get
to this point ...

1168
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,390
and I will not let you ruin it!

1169
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,080
Ow!

1170
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:09,020
"Did you really believe
you could own inspiration?"

1171
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,850
"And through money and greed
achieve world domination?"

1172
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:16,450
"This song is our weapon
against all evil powers!"

1173
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:20,580
"We've come to claim back
what has always been ours!"

1174
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,880
How do you think are musicians
supposed to earn their money?

1175
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,110
By putting up a tip jar?

1176
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,180
Let me tell you this:

1177
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:33,680
Your tip jar belongs to us!

1178
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:37,960
Because we are the ones making
people like you successful.

1179
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,410
We know what the consumers want ...

1180
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:43,130
Because we make consumers want it!

1181
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,470
How are you going to do this with ...

1182
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,980
inspiration?

1183
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,720
Minions! Adjust the speakers!

1184
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,500
Turn up the amplifiers!

1185
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,070
Attack!

1186
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:05,560
What is that ... crap?

1187
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,520
No ...

1188
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:42,680
"You like to pretend
you're promoting the arts."

1189
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:46,270
"But your only worries
are your stock value charts."

1190
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:50,070
"This noise you call music
full of violence and hate,"

1191
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:54,390
"Will soon be forgotten
and meet its due fate."

1192
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,110
No!

1193
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,660
It will never be forgotten!

1194
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:04,650
Because our music is our
intellectual property!

1195
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,360
And we can release the same songs ...

1196
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,650
again and again ...

1197
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:11,860
for every generation!

1198
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,750
We're making sure ...

1199
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,510
only a fraction of all the
music ever made ...

1200
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:18,600
is legally available.

1201
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:20,560
So there is always a market ...

1202
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,270
that is never saturated!

1203
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,550
Isn't this wonderful?

1204
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,600
You want music to be free?

1205
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,740
Only over my dead body!

1206
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:31,660
Minions! Get ready to fire!

1207
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,720
Attack!

1208
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:14,300
"Your greed is unmatched
and your arrogance strong!"

1209
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,970
"You don't even see
that you're terrible wrong."

1210
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,600
"Now comes a new era
where your rules don't apply."

1211
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,950
"Putting back into music
what money can't buy!"

1212
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:33,760
No!

1213
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,380
No!

1214
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,810
This can't be!

1215
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:40,700
No!

1216
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,630
Ths can't be!

1217
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:48,630
?

1218
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:50,220
This is impossible!

1219
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:54,910
Ah! Aaah!

1220
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:05,370
"Let's call to battle
On a musicial scale."

1221
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:13,070
"Through song and through dance
the good will prevail!

1222
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:20,210
"The power of music
in its true form of art"

1223
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:28,650
"Doesn't come in a package,
no it comes from the heart!"

1224
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:32,070
"Victory is ours
and the battle is won!"

1225
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,540
"But let's not forget
that the war still goes on!"

1226
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:39,000
"The fountain's refilled
which may help just a bit."

1227
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:43,580
"But the future will be
what you make of it!"

1228
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:08,380
"Let's call to battle
on a musicial scale!"

1229
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:15,840
"Through song and through dance
the good will prevail!"

1230
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:22,910
"The power of music
in its true form of art"

1231
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:31,300
"Doesn't come in a package,
no it comes from the heart!"

1232
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:37,590
"Let's call to battle
on a musicial scale."

1233
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:45,500
"Through song and through dance
the good will prevail!"

1234
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:52,360
"The power of music
in its true form of art"

1235
01:07:52,830 --> 01:08:01,780
"Doesn't come in a package,
no it comes from the heart!"

1236
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:04,430
Woo!
