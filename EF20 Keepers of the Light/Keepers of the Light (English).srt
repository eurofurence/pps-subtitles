It was the year 385
after the Awakening.

60
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:03,807
The village of Ferndale lay cozily nestled
in the valley of the Serpent River

61
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,922
where the winds sweeping
down from the Holy Mountain

62
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,253
tingled with the scent of pine trees

63
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:12,682
and the streets were filled
with the sounds of playing children

64
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,710
and oxen carts on cobblestone.

65
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:18,078
As with every other village,
each household

66
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,958
needed to have its own holy light.

67
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,553
These were nothing like ordinary lanterns.
They were gifts from the gods.

68
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,124
They shone bright as fire, yet without
flame, and nothing could extinguish them.

69
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:36,405
But the most important thing was that,
while even the strongest walls and gates

70
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,927
could not keep the dark creatures away
that came from the forest in the night

71
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,225
the holy light could.

72
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,264
A home without a light would not
have been a safe place to live

73
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:50,724
and leaving the village without one
at night would have been plain suicide.

74
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:56,087
Over the course of months, however, even
a holy light would eventually begin to dim.

75
00:05:56,365 --> 00:06:00,458
And so, once every year
at the time of the summer solstice

76

farmers, millers, blacksmiths, bakers,
carpenters, spinsters, weavers, cobblers

everyone in the village
who could afford to do so

78
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:13,618
would lay down their work for a day
and celebrate The Festival of Lights.

79
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:16,395
Families would gather in their homes

80
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,676
and selebrate each other’s
company with lots of mulled

81
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,783
wine, mince pie, and
other festive specialties.

82
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,212
Parents would give their children
homemade presents

83
00:06:26,237 --> 00:06:29,890
and in the evening the village priests
would walk from door to door

84
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:33,651
giving everyone their blessing,
and renew the lights in every house.

85
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:37,274
For the villagers, this was
the happiest day of the year

86
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:40,031
 as the return of light to their home
reminded them

87
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:43,357
that the gods and their earthly servants
would always be there

88
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:44,775
to love and protect them.

89

From what? Or... whom?

133
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:53,780
The Keepers at Coldlake.
I was preparing dinner with my mom

134
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:58,477
when they suddenly burst into our house,
armed to their teeth, telling us

135
00:11:58,483 --> 00:11:59,874
we're all arrested.

136
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:03,166
My mother punched the first one
right in the face

137
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:05,250
yelling at me to run for my life.

138
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:07,940
They struck her down with their swords.

139
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,191
I managed to slip past them,
and ran as fast as I could.

140
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,809
I don't know what happened to my mother.
I think she's...

00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:27,305
You hid it well. The scarf covering
the patch of missing fur

145
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:32,415
on your neck, the plague-smell masked with
lilacs and jasmine - all well done, but

146
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,658
the signs are obvious if you know
what to look for.

147
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:41,166
Wow! You knew it all along?
And you still saved me

148
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,968
and took me to your home? Why?

149
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:47,451
If they find out you are hiding a plague bearer...

150
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,184
I am a healer. It's what I do.

151
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:53,218
I swore an oath to help people in need.

152
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,809
If the Keepers want me to leave you to die,
they will have to kill me first.

153

Be careful what you wish for.

154

Don't worry. Brother Strongarm spends
most of his time getting high on incense

155

and Brother Greystone is an old geezer
who can barely remember his own birthday.

156
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,657
They couldn't hurt a fly. We're going to
wrap you up in a blanket

put some powder on your nose,
and tell them I'm treating you for a cold.

things that happened to you and your mother…

Helping ease the pain
is the least I can do.

161
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:36,039
Where was your father when
all this happened?

162
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:44,250
Let's just say, he lives far, far away…
And he won't be back any time soon.

163
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,579
I'm sorry. What happened?

164
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,434
He had to leave us
when I was still a little girl

165
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,741
and the only thing he left behind was…

166
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:53,562
The pendant!

167
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,429
I was wearing a pendant! Where is it?

168
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,444
Relax, relax, it's right here.
On the table.

169
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,688
I took it off of you, so you
wouldn't strangle yourself.

Ahh, thank you!

171
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:07,820
It's the only thing left to
remind me of him.

172
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:11,512
He told me to hold on to it in bad times.

173
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:14,548
Did he tell you what the symbol
in the front means?

174
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,380
No. Why?

175
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:20,197
Because I've seen it before,
at a friend's place.

176
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:24,615
He's sort of an expert on strange things,
and I'm dying to ask him

177
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:25,857
what he might know about it.

178
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:29,136
You'll have to tell me full story
sometime. But not now, of course.

179
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:31,511
The Keepers are coming!
It's time to get you dressed up.

180
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:08,126
Dear community, citizens, and friends.

181
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:15,536
We have once again come together
to celebrate the beginning of a new year

182
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:18,324
and praise the gods of the holy mountain.

183
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:22,002
[Everyone] "As it was, and always will be!"

184
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:27,256
Once more we shall accept
the trial laid upon us

185
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,917
and never falter in our fight against
the evil that hides in the darkness

186
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,441
and those who have been infested by it!

187
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:39,403
[Everyone] "As it was, and always will be!"

188
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:45,959
Once more we shall open our doors
and our hearts

189
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:50,526
and let new light be brought into our homes

190
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:54,618
so it may always shine upon us.

191
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:57,901
[Everyone] "As it was, and always will be!"

192
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:05,244
This year, a very special blessing
and honor has been bestowed upon us.

193
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,793
Brother Greystone and I are getting
old and frail

194
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:18,330
and walking from home to home is a burden
that becomes harder and harder for us.

195
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:25,410
To that end, Great Overseer Ironwill
from the bishopric of Coldlake

196
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:29,774
has decided to favor our humble parish
with his presence.

197
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:33,873
He will lead this year's renewal ceremony

198
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:38,779
for which we thank him
from the bottom of our hearts.

199
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:43,696
Now let the ceremonies begin!

200
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:47,158
Wait!

201
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,798
Ironwill?

202
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:50,575
From Coldlake?

203
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:53,858
No! He knows me! He knows everyone!

204
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,233
Damn! That was not part of my plan.

205
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:59,011
If he sees me, we're both done for!

206
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,976
Don't panic. We're going to improvise.

207
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,946
We just have to convince them that
you have a terrible case of…

208
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:09,513
the flu. Yes. The flu.
Sneeze and cough a lot!

209
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:12,014
That will keep them from
taking a close look at you.

210
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:13,895
What if it doesn't work?

211
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:14,802
Then you run.

212
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,759
There's a window in the back of the house.

213
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:18,604
But it will work, I'm sure.

214
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:21,160
Pull your hat down, here they come.

215
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:26,165
We are coming to bring the light.

216
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:35,475
It's a great honor to welcome you to
my home, Great Overseer Ironwill.

217
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,612
Our light is right here.

218
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,972
A very nice home you have.

219
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:51,903
What is your profession, if I may ask?

220
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,494
I'm a healer.

221
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:59,579
Oh, interesting.
We don't have any of those in Coldlake.

222
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:03,565
Not any more. The last one we had

223
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:07,684
was convicted of witchcraft,
and we had to burn him at the stake

224
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:09,934
not a pretty sight.

225
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:11,646
Um... Yeah.

226
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,315
I errr...

227
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:18,645
Should I worry maybe?

228
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,286
But I guess not.

229
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,996
Don't worry, it's just Riversong.

230
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:30,231
Collecting herbs and mixing ointments
is his passion

231
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,076
and he has never done anything
against the will of the great gods.

232
00:18:36,774 --> 00:18:38,468
And? Who's that?

233
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:41,720
Oh, just a patient. Don't get too close

234
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,941
it's very contagious!

235
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:46,237
You don't want to spread the flu
all over the village, would you?

236
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:50,048
Of course not. Brother Strongarm

237
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:52,167
finish quickly so we can get out of here.

238
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:53,414
Yes, hmmm..

239
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:59,714
I hereby christen this home with
the divine light of the holy mountain

240
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:04,844
May it protect you and your home
from all evil.

241
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:07,708
As it was, and always will be.

242
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,379
Thank you, keepers of the light,
for giving me your gift.

243
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:13,462
I shall always be grateful to you
and the great gods.

244
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,978
Eeeew! Hurry up, Strongarm!

245
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:23,180
I may blindly trust the great gods,
but I'd rather not tempt them.

246
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,629
Yes. Umm... Have a good evening,
Riversong!

247
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:29,617
And my best wishes for your patient.

248
00:19:29,831 --> 00:19:32,513
Ah, thank you. And my best wishes
for you as well.

249
00:19:40,977 --> 00:19:44,056
Wait a minute.
*sniff*

250
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,751
What's that?

251
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:49,793
Lilacs and Jasmine?

252
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:50,926
Yeah... Umm...

253
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:53,181
What kind of flu medicine is that?

254
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:55,702
That - that's just my new herbal tea.

255
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,166
Keeps away the cold… And it's great
if you have sweaty paws.

256
00:19:59,262 --> 00:20:00,931
Like me, huh. See?

257
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:05,368
That's not part of any flu medicine
that I ever heard about.

258
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:10,330
And I could swear I've smelled this before…

259
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,355
Who's the patient of yours again?

260
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,382
Um, no one in particular.
Just a friend from the village.

261
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,463
She's not with her family?

262
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,239
-On festival night?
-Well...

263
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,538
I want to see her!

264
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,546
No, no-no-no-no, that's not a good idea!

265
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,362
That's very bad idea actually!

266
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:30,986
What if you catch the flu?

267
00:20:31,341 --> 00:20:33,089
That's up to the gods!

268
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,756
Now get out of my way.

269
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,389
I think I remember where
I caught that scent before.

270
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:42,471
Frostwind!

271
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:43,495
NO!

272
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:46,979
RUN!

273
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,354
AAAAAAAARGH!

274
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:54,423
Guard! She's out the window! Go get her!

275
00:20:56,807 --> 00:21:00,468
This man has been concealing a person
carrying the dark plague!

276
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:04,692
Dark plague is one of the biggest threats
to our civilization!

277
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:08,145
It's the law of the great gods
of the holy mountain

278
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:12,957
that those who carry it must be eliminated

279
00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:19,054
and those who help the infected
shall be tried with no mercy!

280
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:22,660
As it was, and always will be.

281
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:28,338
Great Overseer, she escaped
into the darkness.

282
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,376
Shall we lock down the gates?

283
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,974
I don't think that will stop her.

284
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:39,955
The walls of this lousy place have cracks
the size of pigrats

285
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:43,468
and finding her outside in the dark
is hopeless.

286
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,036
She was lucky to survive the night once

287
00:21:48,494 --> 00:21:50,583
she won't be so lucky a second time.

288
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,424
Let the night take her.

289
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:56,018
[GROAN]

290
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:58,900
I want him on a trial by tomorrow

291
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:02,830
and I want everyone in the village to see

292
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:08,398
what happens to witchers who bring
the dark plague into our midst.

293
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:20,994
You will see where this gets you.

294
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:25,001
The liege lord is an old friend
of my family.

295
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,856
He knows I'm not a witcher.

296
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:29,858
He would never sentence me…
Never!

297
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:34,121
We'll see… witcher.

298
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:36,417
We'll see.

299
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:53,242
[applause]

300
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:58,114
Come on, Rob…

301
00:22:58,873 --> 00:23:00,673
Don't - don't give up.

302
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:03,084
There's always hope.

303
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,105
There's always hope.

304
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,372
You're almost - almost there.

305
00:23:08,106 --> 00:23:12,733
Father above, we pray and plead
for your most blessed

306
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,477
Holy mercy.

307
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,556
We know, as fallen humans,
we do not deserve it

308
00:23:17,792 --> 00:23:18,809
yet we still have..

309
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:22,697
..reverent spirit by which we can live
a more obedient life..

310
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,811
..through your word..

311
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:27,652
..we pray this...

312
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:30,209
..in the name of your blessed son,
Jesus Christ..

313
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:31,457
..Amen

314
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,922
Wait. What?

315
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:35,177
What's that?

316
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,130
Some... Some sort of military base?

317
00:23:38,825 --> 00:23:40,968
It's... not... not on the map

318
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:46,366
but… there's - there's signs of life
all over the place!

319
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:49,989
Hello! Hello?

320
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:51,452
Is - is anybody there?

321
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:56,256
This is Robert Henson, I'm the last
survivor of my - of my group!

322
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,267
Can you - can you hear me? Please!

323
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,705
I - I need your help!

324
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:04,766
Answer me, please!

325
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:06,401
I'm - I'm a friend!

326
00:24:06,536 --> 00:24:09,992
If there's anybody in there, please,
open the airlock!

327
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:12,480
I know you're in there!

328
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,297
I can see your lights are on!

329
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:17,686
Please! I'll do anything for you, anything!

330
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:20,918
I swear! Please let me in!

331
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:25,138
Go away. This is the new age.

332
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:28,001
Your kind no longer rules this place.

333
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:31,641
My… my kind?

334
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:35,159
What do you mean? I'm a survivor!
Just like you!

335
00:24:35,488 --> 00:24:37,857
We're all of the same kind… aren't we?

336
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,703
I said, go away. This is our final warning.

337
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:45,441
But I have nowhere to go.

338
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,777
And I haven't had anything to drink
for days.

339
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,600
I need water, or I'm going to die!

340
00:24:53,552 --> 00:24:56,456
Come on! Let me in, you bastards!

341
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:58,586
LET ME IN! PLEASE!

342
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:06,023
The door! It opens! Thank you!

343
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:08,676
Whoever you are, thank you!

344
00:25:11,714 --> 00:25:14,237
Who are you? WHAT ARE YOU?

345
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,459
NO! GET AWAY FROM ME!

346
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:21,266
NOOOO! AAAAAAAARRGHT!

347
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:28,525
One more time: This is the new age.

348
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:32,298
Your kind no longer rules this place.

349
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:04,091
Good morning gentlemen.

350
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:10,648
It's my honor and my privilege to announce
that his serene highness

351
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:15,547
Liege Lord Eldercrown of the one…

352
00:26:16,537 --> 00:26:18,402
or the other…

353
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:28,504
Oh what the hell am I even doing here?
My head is killing me!

354
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:31,364
Chippy? Chippytooth? Is that you?

355
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,489
Yes, I'm afraid so.

356
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:38,266
You know, some idiot got himself caught
with a plague bearer

357
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,436
and that smug bastard from Coldlake thought

358
00:26:40,745 --> 00:26:44,964
'Hey, let's just cancel everybody's
holidays and have a lovely trial

359
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:46,814
while everyone's still hung over!'

360
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:49,943
Yeah. Well, sorry for being that idiot,
I guess.

361
00:26:50,393 --> 00:26:53,689
Oh, you will be sorry, believe me.

362
00:26:54,318 --> 00:26:57,551
You picked a bad day for pulling
that kind of shenanigans.

363
00:26:58,204 --> 00:27:02,850
Eldercrown would have given you a slap on
the wrist and sent you home without dessert

364
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:04,386
but Ironwill?

365
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:07,741
That guy is dead serious.

366
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:14,911
Damn!

367
00:27:15,356 --> 00:27:18,084
Ooh, that headache is killing me.

368
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:21,140
How long did you stay up last night?

369
00:27:21,194 --> 00:27:22,550
Too long.

370
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:30,453
We sent the kids to bed at eleven, then
Nightstar and his wife came over, and

371
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:35,111
we ended up killing at least, I think,
half a dozen bottles…

372
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:40,974
When you get home, you should
get some dandelion, mugwort and gentian

373
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:42,814
and let it simmer on the stove for a while.

374
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:46,719
It won't make up for the sleep you lost,
but it will at least help clear your head.

375
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:51,755
Thanks. The old witcher,
always on duty, right?

376
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:54,606
Healer, Chippy. Healer.

377
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:58,360
Whatever you call it, you're not making
my job any easier.

378
00:27:58,671 --> 00:28:02,143
I mean, we've known each other
for how long?

379
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:07,004
And now I'm the one who has to send you
up to the scaffold in the keepers' name.

380
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:12,654
The verdict hasn't been spoken yet.
And you don't have to do this, you know…

381
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:15,820
I am a soldier of the guard.

382
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:20,504
If I refuse to obey the Lord's orders,
I will be the next one

383
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,694
watching his own trial from that cage.

384
00:28:23,209 --> 00:28:25,537
And unlike you, I have a wife and kids.

385
00:28:26,146 --> 00:28:29,799
There is nothing I can do for you, River.
I'm sorry.

386
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,338
It's all right, Chippy.

387
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:36,622
Oh, here we go.

388
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:42,174
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE…

389
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,836
Gentlemen, please stand for the high court:

390
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,197
Brother Strongarm, chronicler of Ferndale.

391
00:28:57,382 --> 00:29:00,018
His serene highness Lord Eldercrown
of Ferndale.

392
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,685
And Great Overseer Ironwill of Coldlake.

393
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:09,214
Are you freaking crazy?

394
00:29:09,494 --> 00:29:13,163
Out… out… out with you! Out! Out!

395
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:14,934
Out!

396
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,741
And stay outside!

397
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:38,437
The High Court of Ferndale
is now in session.

398
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:45,375
Thank you. Will everybody please be seated.

399
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,422
I am calling the case of the People of
Ferndale against Healer Riversong.

400
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,901
Witcher Riversong!

401
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:56,615
Excuse me, Overseer, but would you mind
if we go with the protocol?

402
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:58,472
Certainly.

403
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:01,300
Then please make your opening statement.

404
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:05,338
Your Honor. The accused has been charged

405
00:30:05,363 --> 00:30:09,383
with the crime of performing witchcraft,
desecration of the holy sacrament

406
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:15,376
of the festival of light, and giving
shelter to a bearer of the dark plague.

407
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:20,522
Only the gods of the holy mountain
know where the plague bearer is now.

408
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:26,604
Instead of turning her in,
witcher Riversong decided

409
00:30:26,629 --> 00:30:28,247
to shelter and foster her

410
00:30:28,684 --> 00:30:33,577
releasing her evil darkness
upon the entire town of Ferndale!

411
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,340
I saw it with my own eyes,
and Brother Strongarm can testify

412
00:30:39,947 --> 00:30:44,580
that the accused is guilty as charged!

413
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:48,872
Brother Strongarm, is Overseer Ironwill
correct?

414
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:54,995
Yes, my Lord, I too,
saw it with my own eyes.

415
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,710
I did not want to believe it,
but it is the truth.

416
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:07,205
The divine laws know only one punishment
for this crime.

417
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:09,193
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

418
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:11,156
Am I not allowed to defend myself?

419
00:31:11,212 --> 00:31:13,820
- What kind of trial is this?
- Silence, Witcher!

420
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:18,220
Overseer Ironwill, Riversong is correct.

421
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:21,373
We ought to hear his side of the case
as well.

422
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:26,314
All right, let the witcher talk.

423
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:30,498
I'm a healer, not a witcher!

424
00:31:31,518 --> 00:31:33,841
My desire is to help, not to destroy!

425
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:37,184
I never had any bad intentions,
that's completely absurd!

426
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:40,838
I was on my way home from collecting herbs
when I found her.

427
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:44,142
She was getting attacked by a snapjaw
and a dozen pigrats

428
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:46,044
and she didn't have a light with her.

429
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:47,820
She could no longer defend herself.

430
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:50,042
I had to help, or she would have died!

431
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:53,209
But you knew she had the plague

432
00:31:53,742 --> 00:31:55,672
and that the plague can not be cured.

433
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,365
Of course, my Lord.

434
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,728
But I also know that the whole scare about
how contagious the plague is

435
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:03,087
is nothing but a myth!

436
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,137
I've seen more sick people than any of you

437
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,916
and I've seen my share of
contagious diseases

438
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:11,449
and the dark plague is not one of them.

439
00:32:12,248 --> 00:32:13,757
And even if it can not be cured

440
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:16,598
many people don't even show symptoms
for many years

441
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:20,355
and why shouldn't they be allowed to live
a decent life until then?

442
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:28,060
If it is not infectious,
then why is it so common?

443
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:32,017
I … I don't know. But look at me.

444
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:34,969
If it were so bad, shouldn't I
have it by now?

445
00:32:35,002 --> 00:32:36,156
Witchcraft!

446
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:38,209
Overseer, please.

447
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:41,996
Why are we even listening to this nonsense?

448
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,581
The law is the law.

449
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:48,822
Aiding the plague-infected is a crime
against life itself

450
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:51,813
and must be punished as such!

451
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,476
-Bullshit!
-Riversong!

452
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:57,580
Show some respect, you're in a court
of law!

453
00:32:57,656 --> 00:33:01,036
A fine law you have that commands you
to kill your own people.

454
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:04,151
All right, gentlemen,
this is leading nowhere.

455
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:09,562
Riversong has been a valuable member of
our community for many years.

456
00:33:10,217 --> 00:33:14,953
He was always there to help the sick -
be they nobles, clerics or beggars.

457
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:17,798
I see no ill will in what he did.

458
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:21,248
The death penalty would be excessive.

459
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:27,597
By virtue of the powers bestowed upon me
as the Liege Lord of Ferndale

460
00:33:27,907 --> 00:33:31,218
I hereby decide to let mercy prevail and-

461
00:33:31,258 --> 00:33:32,258
Mercy?

462
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:36,881
Are the gods of the holy mountain
not merciful enough for you?

463
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:37,955
What?

464
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,484
Are you implying that the eternal gods

465
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:43,379
whose mercy is endless

466
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,311
do not look kindly enough upon us
that you put yourself above their laws?

467
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,903
With all due respect, Overseer Ironwill

468
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:58,956
I appreciate your spiritual guidance,
but I am the legitimate ruler of this town

469
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:03,880
and I am the one who speaks justice,
and not you.

470
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:06,390
You are of course right.

471
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:10,350
So I take it that next year,
you would rather not have us

472
00:34:10,363 --> 00:34:12,481
come to your town for the festival.

473
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:19,313
And that you would rather like to see the
dark creatures haunt the streets at night

474
00:34:19,836 --> 00:34:21,516
feeding on the innocent

475
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:23,387
the children

476
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,272
when the lights begin to dim.

477
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,457
I'm sure keeping your town safe will not
pose a challenge

478
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:39,372
to a magnificent ruler like you,
my serene Lord Eldercrown.

479
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,835
I… I'm sorry, Overseer Ironwill.

480
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,359
I concur.

481
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:48,629
This crime calls for a bold example
of justice

482
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:52,460
so that others shall not follow
the witcher's evil path.

483
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:56,499
I hereby condemn you, Riversong of Ferndale

484
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,663
to be hanged at dusk.

485
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:01,434
This is an outrage!

486
00:35:02,216 --> 00:35:05,199
A just decision, my Lord.

487
00:35:05,226 --> 00:35:08,687
Shut up and get out of my town hall.
OUT!

488
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,208
Witcher. As I said.

489
00:35:21,484 --> 00:35:24,222
I am so disappointed in you, son!

490
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:29,989
One day, you will pay for this! I promise!
YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS!

491
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:38,916
And - and what now, my Lord?

492
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:43,505
Now we do what needs to be done.

493
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:49,982
My Lord, may I request to be relieved
of my duties for today?

494
00:35:50,663 --> 00:35:53,300
River and I have known each other
for years.

495
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,960
Please don't make me do this.

496
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,160
Do I look like I am enjoying this?

497
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,867
But still I am doing my duty

498
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:03,511
And I expect you to do the same.

499
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:06,438
Is there anything I can get you
for your hangover?

500
00:36:07,461 --> 00:36:09,910
You know, I was planning to see the healer

501
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:11,829
but I guess that has been taken care of…

502
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:13,757
Oh, don't push it.

503
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:20,582
I'll let my servant bring you some water.
And now please excuse me.

504
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,070
River?

505
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:34,832
Just leave me alone, alright?

506
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,594
Okay.

507
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:14,371
It's me, Frostwind.

508
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,438
Up here. The window.

509
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:21,882
Frostwind! I thought you ran away!

510
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:24,467
How long have you been up there?

511
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:27,000
Long enough to see your trial.

512
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:29,388
We need to get you out of there.

513
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:34,079
I could smash the glass, but if the rat
wakes up before I get to him

514
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:35,739
we're both done for.

515
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:39,248
I have a better idea. Step away from
the window.

516
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:45,647
Chippytooth! Hey!

517
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:48,189
Hey, you! Chippy! Wake up! HEY!

518
00:37:48,472 --> 00:37:51,560
Who… what… where? Oh!

519
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:52,868
Oh, it's you...

520
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,108
Chippy! What the hell are you doing?

521
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,473
You need to stay awake,
or the Lord's going to skin you

522
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:00,789
and use your hide as a throw rug!

523
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,665
I know, I know. If only I wasn't
so damn tired…

524
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:09,068
Yeah, it's really stuffy in here.

525
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:12,525
You should open a window and let some
fresh air in, I'm sure that'll help.

526
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:16,900
Yeah, that makes sense. Let's try that.

527
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:34,643
Fresh air! I feel so much better now!

528
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:46,302
That hurt!

529
00:38:46,385 --> 00:38:49,942
And holy crap, this guy smells
like a brewery!

530
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,136
I...

531
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:59,582
I can't believe you came back for me!
Thank you!

532
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,196
I owed you. But let's not
start celebrating yet…

533
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:08,339
We still need to figure out
where to go from here.

534
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:12,144
Do you remember the friend
I told you about yesterday?

535
00:39:13,472 --> 00:39:14,410
The strange one?

536
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:17,354
Yeah! He lives in a shed
near Serpent River.

537
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:21,293
People fear him because he somehow
manages to survive in the woods

538
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,348
without a holy light.

539
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:25,312
He doesn't give a damn about the Keepers
and their power.

540
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:28,728
He's our only option for a night
outside the village, unless

541
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:31,922
unless you want to room with the
pigrats again.

542
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:38,075
No, thank you, I've had my fill of
snappy-bitey forest critters for this week.

543
00:39:38,124 --> 00:39:41,582
All right! Then let's get the hell out
of here. Follow me.

544
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:56,377
[applause]

545
00:39:57,057 --> 00:40:00,893
Frosty! Hey, Frostwind.
Wake up, little one!

546
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:06,713
But I don't want to wake up.
It's still dark outside.

547
00:40:07,044 --> 00:40:09,978
I know, but daddy needs to tell
you something very important.

548
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:12,798
What is it? Did something happen?

549
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:15,783
Yes. Yes, my dear. Daddy has to leave.

550
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,691
And I'm afraid I won't
be back for a long time.

551
00:40:18,723 --> 00:40:21,166
You mean, like, for a week?

552
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:22,495
No.

553
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,588
-A month?
-No.

554
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:27,100
-A year?
-No.

555
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:30,860
More than a year?
Why? Is it because of me?

556
00:40:31,148 --> 00:40:35,708
I always kept my secret, I
never told anyone, I swear!

557
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:36,776
Not at all.

558
00:40:37,023 --> 00:40:39,239
It's because I've been doing a good job.

559
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,255
The high overseer has asked me to
become a head researcher at the stronghold.

560
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,008
Inside the holy mountain? Wow!

561
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:49,505
That's awesome! I
want to know all about it!

562
00:40:49,744 --> 00:40:52,317
You have to write me a letter every day!

563
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:54,956
I wish I could. But I can't.

564
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:56,871
The keepers would read them.

565
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:59,463
And then bad things would happen.

566
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:00,839
How bad?

567
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,786
Do you remember our little
secret? It's not a game any more.

568
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:07,883
I know I never told you this, but…

569
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:12,749
If anyone finds out who you
really are, the Keepers will kill you.

570
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:15,465
And mother. And possibly me, too.

571
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:17,501
No! What?

572
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,830
No! Please don't leave!

573
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:26,743
You must stay here and
protect us, pleaaasse don't go!

574
00:41:26,768 --> 00:41:29,378
Don't be afraid little one.
You're a strong girl

575
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:31,063
and I know you can keep a secret.

576
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,425
And maybe I won't be able to write you,
but mother is still

577
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,991
one of the best tailors in town.

578
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:41,487
I can still send you clothes to repair,
and who knows, maybe I'll forget …

579
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:43,761
things .. in my pockets.

580
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,806
Like… Like sweets?

581
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:50,745
Yes. How did you know?

582
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:53,888
But don't eat them all. Not at once.

583
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:58,615
I want you to eat one every week.
Not more, not less.

584
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:01,525
Exactly one. And no other sweets.

585
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:03,769
Just those I send you. Do you understand?

586
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:06,648
Yes. But why?

587
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:12,859
Because… well… because…
sweets are bad for your teeth.

588
00:42:13,548 --> 00:42:14,548
Okay.

589
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:20,198
And there's another thing. I want to
give you something before I leave. Here.

590
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:24,397
Wow! Thank you dad, this is beautiful!

591
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:26,854
I want you to wear
this pendant all the time.

592
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:29,649
Whatever happens, never take it off.

593
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,204
Not even when I'm taking a bath?

594
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:36,182
Not even then. Cherish it like life itself

595
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,305
because one day, it might save yours.

596
00:42:39,663 --> 00:42:40,663
How so?

597
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:43,541
You will have to trust me on that.

598
00:42:44,088 --> 00:42:46,463
One day, you will understand all this.

599
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:49,132
But for now, the less you know, the better.

600
00:42:49,694 --> 00:42:52,666
I promise, I will be watching
over you from the holy mountain.

601
00:42:53,176 --> 00:42:56,972
And I have a dream that one day
all this won't be necessary any more.

602
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:59,940
Who knows. Maybe that dream will come true

603
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,655
and we'll see each other again.

604
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:05,908
Now come here, and give daddy
a hug. It's time to say goodbye.

605
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:10,934
I love you, dad. Please don't go.

606
00:43:11,178 --> 00:43:15,260
I love you too. But I have - I have to go.

607
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:17,872
Farewell my little one.

608
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:20,117
Farewell.

609
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:25,762
I see daylight! Finally! I'll race you!

610
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:28,307
HEY! Be careful!

611
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:39,199
Damn… just a few years ago

612
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,692
I used to outrun the fastest
boys of town. Now look at me.

613
00:43:45,409 --> 00:43:48,125
I think you're doing pretty well!

614
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:53,058
Fiddlesticks! I'm getting worse
every day and you know it.

615
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:58,814
Well, you still keep on going.
You have a strong will to live!

616
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:04,057
It's really just a strong desire to
get out of dark, gloomy caves fast.

617
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:06,576
Don't you belittle my caves!

618
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:10,341
It's a treasure house of
useful herbs and mushrooms!

619
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,977
So, your mysterious
friend… is he a healer, too?

620
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:17,794
Yes and no. He...

621
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:21,956
is more of a… substance researcher.

622
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:25,963
Like, cave mushrooms?

623
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,841
Yeah, you gotta be careful with those.

624
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,120
Too much of them, and they willl cause
a total loss of all basic motor functions.

625
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:36,462
The mind recoils in horror, unable
to communicate with the body.

626
00:44:36,772 --> 00:44:40,484
You can actually watch yourself
behaving in terrible, terrible ways

627
00:44:40,492 --> 00:44:43,420
 but you can't control it. Nasty stuff!

628
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:52,731
Wait! *sniff* *sniff*
Do you smell that too?

629
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:57,736
Smoke! Smoke! By the gods!

630
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:04,183
Oh no! The cabin! Burned to the ground!

631
00:45:04,637 --> 00:45:06,938
Is this where he used to live?

632
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:09,962
Yeah! Poor Bottlebrush!

633
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:11,888
Bottlebrush?

634
00:45:12,264 --> 00:45:15,051
Yeah! This was his
house, and now it's all gone!

635
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:19,443
His name is… Bottlebrush?

636
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:23,596
Yeah, for the mountain's sake, it is.

637
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:27,114
Well, that explains why he's hiding.

638
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,198
Yes, and now he's possibly
dead, what a great opportunity

639
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:34,282
to make some more fun of him!

640
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,370
I'm sorry.

641
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:37,596
I want to know what happened.

642
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,304
Maybe we can find something in the ashes.

643
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,236
Whoever did this was very
thorough. There's almost nothing left.

644
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:54,864
Yes. And I smell... I smell oil.
It's all over the place.

645
00:45:55,364 --> 00:45:58,104
This wasn't an accident. Have you found…

646
00:45:59,622 --> 00:46:00,744
have you found a body?

647
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:03,355
No, nothing.

648
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:10,160
Then let's cross our claws
that he managed to get away.

649
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,555
I guess that means our stay for
the night has been canceled, huh?

650
00:46:16,268 --> 00:46:19,086
Yeah. We're stuck. Dear gods.

651
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,629
Oh, look what I found!

652
00:46:30,217 --> 00:46:33,236
What... What is it?

653
00:46:33,704 --> 00:46:38,586
It's a strange drawing showing
some strange… creature.

654
00:46:39,565 --> 00:46:45,735
[laughter, applause]

655
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:50,156
Oh! Yeah, that's typical for old Brushie.

656
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:53,597
The strange creature is called a "human".

657
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:58,324
Brushie's home used
to be full of stuff like that.

658
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:02,905
A human! My mom used to
tell me fairy tales about them.

659
00:47:03,142 --> 00:47:07,125
When I was little, I really
believed they existed!

660
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:10,806
Somewhere in the woods, hunting us kids

661
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:16,020
Brushie was totally obsessed with humans.

662
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,457
He spent his whole life digging through
old ruins, looking for artifacts.

663
00:47:21,898 --> 00:47:26,641
The Keepers have declared the ruins a
holy site, but that never concerned him.

664
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:30,209
He ended up with quite a
collection - tools, statues, art

665
00:47:30,742 --> 00:47:32,237
lots of mysterious things.

666
00:47:32,996 --> 00:47:35,196
He reminds me a lot of my father.

667
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:39,893
I was too young to really
understand what he was doing, but

668
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:43,175
I think he was also
searching for something.

669
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,529
He would often disappear
into the forest for hours

670
00:47:46,645 --> 00:47:50,582
and return with boxes
full of strange things …

671
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,087
How did he manage to
get around the keepers?

672
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,638
He… he is one of them.

673
00:47:57,228 --> 00:47:58,228
WHAT?

674
00:47:59,026 --> 00:48:03,550
Yes. I am the daughter of
Silverstreak the Dressmaker

675
00:48:03,816 --> 00:48:09,133
and Brother Fireheart of Pinecrest,
former High Overseer of Coldlake.

676
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:12,868
A bastard. Half Keeper, half mundane.

677
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:13,924
Wow!

678
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,811
Your mother broke a Keeper's bloodline?

679
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:21,298
She could as well have
set the temple on fire.

680
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:24,993
Of course they never told anyone about it.

681
00:48:25,255 --> 00:48:27,316
Officially I'm an orphan.

682
00:48:27,587 --> 00:48:30,232
As long as father was
still living in Coldlake

683
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:33,979
he would come to our house,
pretending to do business with my mom.

684
00:48:34,683 --> 00:48:37,559
When he was ordered back
to the holy mountain one day

685
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:40,996
he promised to do everything
he could to protect us

686
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:44,668
but we knew we'd most
likely never see him again.

687
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,644
Oh! I think - I think I've found something.

688
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:54,312
Frostwind, show me your
pendant again, please.

689
00:48:54,617 --> 00:48:56,336
Here! Why?

690
00:48:58,282 --> 00:49:01,207
Because I knew I had seen it before!

691
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:07,164
This... This little sign
used to hang above the door.

692
00:49:08,017 --> 00:49:09,893
Maybe it's like a secret guild symbol

693
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,441
and your father wanted you to seek out others
who wear this sign if you're in trouble?

694
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:16,673
Maybe… maybe not…

695
00:49:22,354 --> 00:49:27,003
Hmmmrmmmm! Hrrrm! Hmmm
mmm mm mmm mm hrmmpfhmphmph!

696
00:49:27,704 --> 00:49:28,704
Eh...

697
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,421
Who are you? What do you want?

698
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,110
Hmmmrmmmm! Hrrrm! Hmmm
mmm mm mmm mm hrmmpfhmphmph!

699
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:39,852
Eh, sorry, but eh… I don't understand you…

700
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:43,588
Hrmrmrmtmmtmtmmtmtmmm!

701
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,857
Awww! Isn't he adorable?
Look at that little cape

702
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:50,972
and a little itsy-bitsy knife!

703
00:49:51,185 --> 00:49:54,577
Maybe he's lost, and wants
to find his way back to his mommy?

704
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,466
I don't think so.

705
00:49:59,985 --> 00:50:02,605
You've something that
we want. Give it to me.

706
00:50:02,853 --> 00:50:04,871
Hmmhmmhmmhmmhmm hmmhmm hmm!

707
00:50:05,054 --> 00:50:06,854
I know that's what you said

708
00:50:07,253 --> 00:50:11,042
and if you weren't too stupid
to wear your scarf properly

709
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:13,132
maybe they could understand you, too!

710
00:50:13,162 --> 00:50:15,166
Hrrrrrmph!

711
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:19,041
So...

712
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:24,126
Now, milady, show me your necklace.

713
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:26,723
Here… take it...

714
00:50:29,615 --> 00:50:32,454
You are carrying the sign.
But that alone is not enough.

715
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:36,779
You said your father, Brother
Fireheart of Pinecrest, gave this to you.

716
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:38,605
Prove it.

717
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:41,877
"Light so Bright, Light so Pure."

718
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:43,790
Now you.

719
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:46,946
Oh, it's a code!

720
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:49,490
No, that's not a code.

721
00:50:49,657 --> 00:50:51,795
It's a song that mother taught me.

722
00:50:51,957 --> 00:50:57,472
"Light so Bright, Light so Pure.
Keepers of the Light, Answer me True!"

723
00:50:58,408 --> 00:51:01,142
Thank you, but I think I've heard enough.

724
00:51:01,448 --> 00:51:04,283
Bottlebrush! You're alive!

725
00:51:04,345 --> 00:51:05,618
Of course I am.

726
00:51:07,154 --> 00:51:11,376
Please welcome our friends: Frostwind
of Coldlake, and Riversong of Ferndale.

727
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:19,461
May I introduce myself?
I am Longleaf of Camp Freedom.

728
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:23,311
I'm sorry I had to scare you like
that, but we had to make sure that you are

729
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,271
well, who you say you are.

730
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:32,983
Damn the gods, I thought
this thing would suffocate me!

731
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:38,720
Hi, I'm Bitternut! Nice to meet you!

732
00:51:40,818 --> 00:51:44,972
Brushie, old chap, what on
earth happened to your house?

733
00:51:45,221 --> 00:51:46,765
Burned down by the Keepers.

734
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:50,007
They've been very active lately,
combing through the woods

735
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:54,013
sending new overseers to all the villages,
burning witches at the stake.

736
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:54,622
Yeah

737
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:57,461
But I got a warning from our
scouts and got away in time.

738
00:51:57,557 --> 00:51:59,106
Your scouts?

739
00:51:59,373 --> 00:52:02,385
Your father didn't tell you
what the symbol means, right?

740
00:52:03,317 --> 00:52:05,117
It's the tree of knowledge.

741
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:07,800
The secret sign of the Rebel Underground.

742
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:12,160
The Keepers' reign is a tyranny,
and someone needs to stop them.

743
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:14,945
That someone… is us!

744
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:19,173
Your father has been one
of our biggest supporters.

745
00:52:19,475 --> 00:52:20,936
All in secrecy, of course.

746
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:25,130
That makes you, my
lady, a very welcome guest.

747
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,490
Brushie, you never told me!

748
00:52:27,517 --> 00:52:29,197
You didn't have to know.

749
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:34,679
But it's getting dark and I'm sure you both
need a good meal and a warm place to sleep.

750
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:39,920
Please come on, follow me, I will lead
you the way to Camp Freedom.

751
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:44,245
Is that like, your secret base?

752
00:52:45,105 --> 00:52:47,772
Much more than that, my dear. Much more.

753
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:52,295
Once there, I promise you
two will have a lot of catching up to do.

754
00:52:53,143 --> 00:52:54,143
Let's go!

755
00:52:54,899 --> 00:52:55,899
This way!

756
00:52:56,071 --> 00:52:59,656
I don't believe all this.
I don't believe all this!

757
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:09,739
[applause]

758
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:20,043
Welcome to Camp Freedom!

759
00:53:24,897 --> 00:53:25,897
Huh

760
00:53:26,327 --> 00:53:27,327
Wow!

761
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,430
This is a lot bigger than I expected!

762
00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:36,146
And look at all these
lights! What magic is that?

763
00:53:37,186 --> 00:53:40,611
Electricity! Science, not magic!

764
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:42,761
You will learn all about it, I promise.

765
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:45,066
But first, let me introduce you.

766
00:53:45,818 --> 00:53:50,082
HEAR HEAR! We have a
very special guest today!

767
00:53:50,462 --> 00:53:57,177
Please all welcome Frostwind of Coldlake,
daughter of Brother Fireheart, our savior!

768
00:53:57,202 --> 00:53:58,838
[everyone cheering]

769
00:53:58,941 --> 00:54:02,528
[everyone] -Long live Fireheart! Long live Fireheart!
-Hi everybody

770
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:04,142
Nice to meet you!

771
00:54:05,732 --> 00:54:08,133
Why are they all cheering?

772
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:13,169
Without your father, we'd
all still be sitting in the dark

773
00:54:13,508 --> 00:54:18,188
begging some priest for pieces of radioactive
rock to protect us from the pigrats.

774
00:54:18,552 --> 00:54:22,377
Uh wait… isn't Fireheart a keeper himself?

775
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:28,974
Yes, and he's been secretly
supplying us with everything we need

776
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,517
right from inside the Keepers' stronghold.

777
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:33,339
And more than that.

778
00:54:33,454 --> 00:54:37,294
He enlightened us with the
ancient knowledge of our creators.

779
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:43,703
All this because he fell in love with a
commoner who opened his eyes to the truth.

780
00:54:44,058 --> 00:54:46,631
You know him? Where is he now?

781
00:54:47,347 --> 00:54:49,848
Oh yes, I've met him many times.

782
00:54:50,298 --> 00:54:52,386
He still works inside the holy mountain

783
00:54:52,784 --> 00:54:55,797
helping maintain and
operate the ancient machinery.

784
00:54:59,976 --> 00:55:02,576
Attention, everybody, please stand back

785
00:55:02,704 --> 00:55:06,156
and don't touch any metal parts!
Activate in 3…

786
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:07,570
2…

787
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,990
1…

788
00:55:11,223 --> 00:55:12,541
-Wow!
-Yes!

789
00:55:12,963 --> 00:55:18,996
IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIIIIIVEEEEE!
MUHAHAHAHA!

790
00:55:20,471 --> 00:55:21,499
What?

791
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:24,492
What is that thing?!

792
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:32,051
Sparky… of all the useful
artifacts still in storage

793
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:36,447
you choose to repair the
fucking soda machine? Seriously?

794
00:55:37,234 --> 00:55:39,701
Oh, forgive me! I only
got four transformers

795
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:42,891
the rod charging stations, the
three extra field generators and

796
00:55:42,915 --> 00:55:45,105
the electric fence back online today.

797
00:55:45,145 --> 00:55:48,045
Can't I do something
just for fun after hours?

798
00:55:55,927 --> 00:55:58,450
Here, that'll help you pull
that stick out of your ass.

799
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:06,979
Are you kidding me? This
stuff is at least 500 years old.

800
00:56:07,578 --> 00:56:10,819
Well, according to the label
it has no natural ingredients

801
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,623
and twice the half-life of plutonium.

802
00:56:12,683 --> 00:56:15,149
What could possibly go wrong? Cheers!

803
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,110
[laughter, applause]

804
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,191
Ah! The crowning achievement
of human civilization!

805
00:56:24,588 --> 00:56:27,209
COME ON EVERYBODY, THE
DRINKS ARE ON THE HOUSE TONIGHT!

806
00:56:27,571 --> 00:56:32,614
[everyone cheering]

807
00:56:32,753 --> 00:56:37,015
[upbeat music starts playing]

808
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:42,309
[everyone] Awwwwwwwww!

809
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:45,949
God damn! Come on you rusty piece of junk!

810
00:56:46,411 --> 00:56:49,375
[everyone cheering again]

811
00:56:51,507 --> 00:56:52,507
But...

812
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,400
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?

813
00:56:56,408 --> 00:56:58,256
*gasp* It's Stormrunner!

814
00:56:58,314 --> 00:56:59,314
What? Who?

815
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:02,169
Who?

816
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:04,939
The leader of the rebellion!

817
00:57:05,058 --> 00:57:06,782
Just do as everyone else does!

818
00:57:08,768 --> 00:57:14,999
Do you think this is a game? Do I
have to remind you why we are all here?

819
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:20,155
People are suffering and dying every day

820
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:24,288
because they are denied the
knowledge of their true heritage

821
00:57:24,966 --> 00:57:28,317
by some 'god' inside the holy mountain!

822
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:32,042
We will end the Keepers' reign!

823
00:57:32,885 --> 00:57:38,433
Teach the people the ancient knowledge
of our creators that they have been denied

824
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,236
and bring enlightenment to the world!

825
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:43,887
[everyone] Yeeeah!

826
00:57:45,744 --> 00:57:48,085
I have great news, everyone!

827
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:53,164
Brother Fireheart has gained
control of the stronghold's power grid.

828
00:57:53,966 --> 00:57:58,510
An electrical fire is going to cause
a complete outage of the north wing

829
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:02,897
shutting down all locks,
defenses and security systems.

830
00:58:03,765 --> 00:58:07,599
This is our chance to
march into their sanctuary

831
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:11,109
take control of their 'god machine'.

832
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:14,003
Team Alpha will leave in three hours.

833
00:58:14,297 --> 00:58:16,922
That means every trained fighter.

834
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,254
Only a skeleton crew will stay at the base.

835
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:24,137
This is our day, brothers and sisters!

836
00:58:24,162 --> 00:58:27,075
[everyone] Yeeeah!

837
00:58:33,028 --> 00:58:36,144
Well... Looks like this is it!

838
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:38,700
The stronghold is a day away

839
00:58:38,942 --> 00:58:43,102
so by about this time tomorrow
the dark ages will finally be over.

840
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:46,617
And what are we going…

841
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:52,155
What's wrong with her?

842
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:55,985
Ah, she's got the dark plague,
and she's getting weaker and weaker.

843
00:58:56,506 --> 00:59:01,242
The dark plague you say! At
her age? Now that's unusual.

844
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,499
Yes. It looks like she only
caught it a few weeks ago.

845
00:59:05,825 --> 00:59:09,017
Something doesn't make sense here.
You don't 'catch' the dark plague.

846
00:59:09,276 --> 00:59:10,843
It's a genetic predisposition.

847
00:59:11,427 --> 00:59:15,028
A… genetic… what?

848
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,700
It means, that you're either
born with it, or you are not.

849
00:59:19,872 --> 00:59:21,552
I have no explanation.

850
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,503
All I know is that she didn't show
any symptoms until a few days ago.

851
00:59:27,729 --> 00:59:31,163
I need to tell you something.
That pendant she's wearing

852
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:34,839
the tree of knowledge, do you
know why her father gave it to her?

853
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:36,492
I have no idea.

854
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:41,465
The amulet was Fireheart's failsafe.

855
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,476
He didn't want to reveal
Frostwind's identity to anyone.

856
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:48,084
So he gave her the
pendant and a secret phrase

857
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:52,806
so she could identify herself in
case he could no longer care for her.

858
00:59:53,283 --> 00:59:57,367
Even I didn't know who she was
until you two showed up at my house.

859
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:04,330
Fireheart must really love his daughter…

860
01:00:04,355 --> 01:00:07,156
He does. But this is also terrifying

861
01:00:07,794 --> 01:00:11,352
This was supposed to be the
last resort if everything else fails.

862
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:13,456
Something isn't right here.

863
01:00:15,062 --> 01:00:16,949
I'll make sure to keep that in mind, but...

864
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:20,661
anyway, we need to get her
to a place where she can rest.

865
01:00:23,497 --> 01:00:25,350
Could you please take
care of her for a moment?

866
01:00:26,393 --> 01:00:27,593
I have an idea.

867
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:46,875
Frosty? Hey, Frosty! Wake up, come on!

868
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:49,015
Do you hear me?

869
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,419
River? What happened?

870
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,475
Here, I've got something to drink for you.

871
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:06,161
Easy, Frosty, Easy. Come
on, we need to get to

872
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:08,580
get you and... you can
get some rest, okay?

873
01:01:08,855 --> 01:01:10,035
Do you think you can walk?

874
01:01:10,286 --> 01:01:11,643
Here, I'll help you.

875
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:13,801
You can use that tent by the oak tree.

876
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:15,971
Okay, great.

877
01:01:19,547 --> 01:01:20,487
-Boss?
-Hm?

878
01:01:20,518 --> 01:01:22,155
I know you… what's wrong?

879
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:26,171
I don't know...

880
01:01:32,158 --> 01:01:35,423
Something … I can't put my paw on it.

881
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:37,530
Something isn't right.

882
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:40,833
But Team Alpha is on its way now

883
01:01:41,047 --> 01:01:44,821
and there's nothing we can do -
except wait, and hope.

884
01:01:50,176 --> 01:02:00,802
[applause]

885
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:06,655
Frosty?

886
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,307
Yes?

887
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:11,215
It's freezing, isn't it?

888
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:16,478
Yes. It's a starry night.
Beautiful. But cold.

889
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:20,716
Would you... Would you mind if I
come over to your side?

890
01:02:21,153 --> 01:02:24,577
-Oh! Well…
-Only if you want! Only if you want.

891
01:02:25,234 --> 01:02:27,469
No, no, it's fine.

892
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:29,088
I feel lonely, too.

893
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:33,693
Come over here kittycat,
this blanket has space for two.

894
01:02:34,593 --> 01:02:35,593
On my way!

895
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:44,811
Feeling better now?

896
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:48,729
Much better… mrrrr… you're so cuddly…

897
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:50,092
[purring]

898
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:54,135
Oh my god! You can purr! That is so cute!

899
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:57,455
Oh… uhm… Yes I can. But

900
01:02:57,963 --> 01:03:01,274
I'm trying not to. It's so… So childish.

901
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:04,695
No, it's not. It's just cute.

902
01:03:04,738 --> 01:03:07,915
But men aren't supposed to be cute.

903
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:11,963
Under my blanket, you
can be as cute as you want.

904
01:03:13,271 --> 01:03:14,311
Alright then!

905
01:03:14,475 --> 01:03:17,792
[purring intensifies]

906
01:03:23,462 --> 01:03:25,142
What is it this time?

907
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,958
I can't stop thinking about all
the things that happened today

908
01:03:29,951 --> 01:03:32,274
and how it all fits together.

909
01:03:32,362 --> 01:03:35,079
For example, Fireheart
gave you the amulet

910
01:03:35,151 --> 01:03:38,844
and the song to identify yourself,
and get help when you need it.

911
01:03:38,925 --> 01:03:41,253
But why so complicated?

912
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,314
It was pure luck we
ended up here so quickly.

913
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,433
If you father works at the stronghold

914
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:49,797
I would expect him to know what
happened in Coldlake yesterday.

915
01:03:50,351 --> 01:03:53,208
Why didn't he send one
of the rebels to get you out?

916
01:03:54,062 --> 01:03:56,432
Because that would have blown his cover?

917
01:03:57,652 --> 01:03:58,652
Possible.

918
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:03,486
But I feel like there's a whole different
side to this story that we're missing out on.

919
01:04:03,586 --> 01:04:07,610
Is there - is there anything else
your father gave to you?

920
01:04:08,631 --> 01:04:09,849
Not really.

921
01:04:09,873 --> 01:04:12,596
The only contact we had
was when he sent batches of

922
01:04:12,612 --> 01:04:14,941
worn out robes for my mother to fix.

923
01:04:15,592 --> 01:04:18,409
He was too afraid to send written notes

924
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:21,927
so sometimes he put things
into one of the robes' pockets

925
01:04:21,952 --> 01:04:25,965
as if they had been forgotten to
let us know everything is alright.

926
01:04:26,106 --> 01:04:30,912
Coins, little gemstones, a
little extra support for mom.

927
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:36,110
Oh, and he also used to send me
sweets so I don't have to be so sad.

928
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:38,976
But he stopped sending those a while ago.

929
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:42,099
I guess he thought I was getting too old.

930
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:46,195
How about that song
your father taught you…

931
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,590
"Light so Bright, Light so True"

932
01:04:49,004 --> 01:04:51,155
Did he ever tell you what it means?

933
01:04:51,572 --> 01:04:54,833
No, only that is was part of our secret

934
01:04:54,913 --> 01:04:59,631
and that bad things would happen
if I sung it to anyone but myself.

935
01:05:00,662 --> 01:05:04,031
Do you think that bad things
will happen if you sing it to me?

936
01:05:04,056 --> 01:05:06,100
Because I'd really like to hear it…

937
01:05:08,555 --> 01:05:11,792
No, I don't think so. It goes like this:

938
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:21,096
♪ Light so Bright, Light so Pure ♪

939
01:05:21,939 --> 01:05:29,428
♪ Keepers of Light, Answer me True! ♪

940
01:05:30,172 --> 01:05:37,531
♪ Light so Bright, so Pure, Light so True ♪

941
01:05:38,283 --> 01:05:42,037
♪ I give myself to you ♪

942
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:45,734
Beautiful.

943
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:47,232
And mysterious.

944
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:48,906
Just like you.

945
01:05:49,996 --> 01:05:52,101
Oh, thank you, River.

946
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:55,391
Do you think we're safe here?

947
01:05:56,298 --> 01:05:59,216
With you around, every place feels safe.

948
01:05:59,279 --> 01:06:03,387
[purring intensifies further]

949
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:05,150
Please keep doing that…

950
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:07,883
please keep doing it all night long…

951
01:06:25,105 --> 01:06:34,078
[relaxed music]

952
01:06:36,984 --> 01:06:41,100
[panting, then giggling]

953
01:06:41,303 --> 01:06:47,752
[more giggling]

954
01:06:48,497 --> 01:06:49,974
What? What is it?

955
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:54,468
What?

956
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,750
I...

957
01:06:56,325 --> 01:06:58,965
I er I think I bit my tongue.

958
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,117
What?!

959
01:07:03,256 --> 01:07:04,407
I... Yeah

960
01:07:05,296 --> 01:07:07,844
I - I tried so hard to be quiet

961
01:07:07,971 --> 01:07:09,121
that I bit my...

962
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:14,440
[giggling]

963
01:07:14,473 --> 01:07:15,473
Shhhh!

964
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:16,898
Quiet!

965
01:07:17,844 --> 01:07:19,616
What if they hear us?

966
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:21,454
Oi!

967
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,393
Are you finally done fucking yet?

968
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:28,277
[laughter, applause]

969
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:35,394
Some people want to sleep, you know!

970
01:07:36,951 --> 01:07:37,951
Ah, screw it

971
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:40,582
I'll go for a walk until
you two are through!

972
01:07:44,215 --> 01:07:47,488
Oh dear, so much for our good reputation.

973
01:07:50,117 --> 01:07:52,333
Do you think that guy has a boner now?

974
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:57,024
Well, he sure did pitch a tent.

975
01:08:00,818 --> 01:08:02,473
Frosty, Frosty…

976
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,805
I would have never thought
that you're such a naughty girl!

977
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:09,731
You know…

978
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:12,914
in times like these,
it's hard to stay sane.

979
01:08:13,196 --> 01:08:15,724
I needed this… I needed you!

980
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,640
Me too.

981
01:08:20,232 --> 01:08:22,334
I haven't felt this
complete in a long time.

982
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:24,572
I'm so glad I met you.

983
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:26,225
Are you sure?

984
01:08:26,442 --> 01:08:27,442
I mean

985
01:08:27,473 --> 01:08:29,544
even with all the trouble I've caused?

986
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:42,957
You remind me of someone.

987
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,764
You know, that's one of
the worst things to say

988
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,121
-right after you...
-No-no-no!

989
01:08:48,938 --> 01:08:49,949
No-no-no!

990
01:08:51,403 --> 01:08:55,032
It's not what... It's not
what you think, it's...

991
01:08:56,045 --> 01:09:00,129
Have you ever wondered why a guy of my age
is living in such a big house, all alone?

992
01:09:01,783 --> 01:09:04,291
Well... Something bad happened, right?

993
01:09:06,265 --> 01:09:09,243
I grew up going to the keepers' temple

994
01:09:09,593 --> 01:09:11,652
listening to the priests' sermons.

995
01:09:11,935 --> 01:09:15,666
I learned how the gods blessed the
animals living on the holy mountain

996
01:09:15,691 --> 01:09:18,910
and gave them a mind of
their own, the ability to speak.

997
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:21,236
Made the keepers our shepherds.

998
01:09:21,798 --> 01:09:25,443
I wanted to show the gods my
gratitude for as long as I lived.

999
01:09:26,743 --> 01:09:27,992
Until one day.

1000
01:09:28,349 --> 01:09:29,469
What happened?

1001
01:09:31,103 --> 01:09:32,969
I had a wife I loved dearly.

1002
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:35,376
But something happened to her.

1003
01:09:35,763 --> 01:09:37,146
The light in the house, it...

1004
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:39,040
it began to blind her.

1005
01:09:39,188 --> 01:09:40,938
Even when the shutters were closed.

1006
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:43,188
Even when her eyes were closed.

1007
01:09:44,009 --> 01:09:45,531
It got worse every day.

1008
01:09:45,569 --> 01:09:47,998
She just wanted to run
away and hide from it, like...

1009
01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:50,275
Like a snapjaw.

1010
01:09:50,605 --> 01:09:51,861
Or a pigrat.

1011
01:09:52,795 --> 01:09:55,245
I didn't... Didn't know what to do.

1012
01:09:55,754 --> 01:09:57,821
So I brought her to the temple.

1013
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,398
The keepers were our shepherds, right?

1014
01:10:01,495 --> 01:10:03,555
They kept her there,
and sent me home. And...

1015
01:10:04,085 --> 01:10:05,809
When I came back next day

1016
01:10:07,572 --> 01:10:08,728
she was gone.

1017
01:10:10,925 --> 01:10:11,708
They...

1018
01:10:11,733 --> 01:10:16,163
They told me that the gods had decided
she was possessed by darkness.

1019
01:10:16,316 --> 01:10:18,583
By the gods! Are you saying they…

1020
01:10:19,019 --> 01:10:20,019
-I mean…
-I...

1021
01:10:20,103 --> 01:10:22,484
I never found out what -
what they did to her. But

1022
01:10:23,696 --> 01:10:28,394
What I do know is that that
was the day I stopped believing.

1023
01:10:29,348 --> 01:10:33,391
And I swore that I would never let
something like that happen again.

1024
01:10:34,507 --> 01:10:38,264
And then you decided to let
me ruin what's left of your life?

1025
01:10:38,265 --> 01:10:39,490
No, Frostwind. It's...

1026
01:10:39,889 --> 01:10:41,370
It's exactly the opposite.

1027
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:46,258
Ever since I lost my wife,
I have been dead inside.

1028
01:10:47,114 --> 01:10:49,496
You made me feel alive again.

1029
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,798
And look where you've taken us!

1030
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:54,717
We're in a place full of
things that would have been

1031
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:56,817
magic to us only yesterday.

1032
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,754
Right now, I couldn't be happier!

1033
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:05,803
I love you, Frostwind, and I want
to stay with you until all eternity!

1034
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:09,818
I love you too, River! But
you know I'm going to die!

1035
01:11:09,828 --> 01:11:12,158
No. No, you are not.

1036
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:16,598
I swear, on my life, that I
will find a way for you to live.

1037
01:11:17,746 --> 01:11:18,936
[BRZZZZT]

1038
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:25,315
Wait! What was that just now?

1039
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:26,870
I don't know.

1040
01:11:26,895 --> 01:11:27,895
[BRZZZZT]

1041
01:11:29,019 --> 01:11:30,886
Is that one of the machines?

1042
01:11:31,432 --> 01:11:33,757
Whatever it is, I don't
like the sound of it…

1043
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:34,820
[BRZZZZT]

1044
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:37,509
Okay, that's it, I'm
going to check it out.

1045
01:11:37,569 --> 01:11:38,569
Be careful!

1046
01:11:38,623 --> 01:11:40,667
Don't worry. I'll be back in a minute.

1047
01:11:50,917 --> 01:11:51,917
Hello?

1048
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,576
Are you still awake?

1049
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:58,555
Did you also hear that noise?

1050
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:01,754
You know, it went like …

1051
01:12:01,946 --> 01:12:04,311
[BRZZZZT]
-AAAAAH!

1052
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,837
Yes, that's exactly how it sounds.

1053
01:12:09,856 --> 01:12:11,449
[diabolical laughter]
-No!..

1054
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:13,997
Oh hello.

1055
01:12:14,524 --> 01:12:19,319
How rude of me to interrupt
your tender moment.

1056
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:22,679
If I had known that you're
Fireheart's little bastard

1057
01:12:22,931 --> 01:12:26,319
I would have taken so
much better care of you.

1058
01:12:29,318 --> 01:12:32,341
What do you want, Ironwill?

1059
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:34,153
Nothing.

1060
01:12:35,027 --> 01:12:37,099
Just you.

1061
01:12:38,061 --> 01:12:41,721
I'm afraid this is
going to hurt quite a bit.

1062
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:48,825
Scream if you want, there
is nobody left to hear it.

1063
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:52,210
[BRZZZZT]
-AAAAAH!

1064
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:54,983
Ah... Brother Strongarm?

1065
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:56,682
Are we ready to leave?

1066
01:12:57,761 --> 01:13:02,920
Yes, Overseer. They are all knocked out.

1067
01:13:03,523 --> 01:13:04,523
Excellent.

1068
01:13:05,254 --> 01:13:07,747
I've got what I was looking for.

1069
01:13:08,081 --> 01:13:11,206
Set this place ablaze and follow quickly.

1070
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:14,019
We must get to the
mountain before the rebels.

1071
01:13:14,283 --> 01:13:17,086
Hey, wait a minute, what about me?

1072
01:13:17,263 --> 01:13:20,713
I let you inside the camp and I
showed you where her tent is.

1073
01:13:20,904 --> 01:13:22,472
What about my reward?

1074
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:25,285
Oh, of course!

1075
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:28,224
You shall get your reward!

1076
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:31,830
Brother Strongarm, would you be so kind?

1077
01:13:32,058 --> 01:13:33,610
Most certainly.

1078
01:13:33,715 --> 01:13:34,715
[BRZZZZT]
-AAH!

1079
01:13:36,189 --> 01:13:39,693
Now set this place on fire.

1080
01:13:40,044 --> 01:13:41,719
I will.

1081
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:48,157
And you are coming with me.

1082
01:13:58,363 --> 01:13:59,799
[BRZZZZT]

1083
01:14:01,476 --> 01:14:11,707
[fire cracking]

1084
01:14:14,647 --> 01:14:21,578
[dramatic music]

1085
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:26,714
[panting]

1086
01:14:26,826 --> 01:14:27,826
Oh shit!

1087
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:29,974
Holy fucking shit

1088
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:31,797
-Do you believe me now?
-What have they done?

1089
01:14:31,837 --> 01:14:33,765
-Yeah, yeah!
-I told you it was a trap.

1090
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:36,921
Yeah, but... Why
Bitternut of all people?

1091
01:14:38,035 --> 01:14:40,229
I don't care, we need to act.

1092
01:14:40,467 --> 01:14:43,108
Get as many people out
of their tents as you can!

1093
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,503
-Oh shit!
-Okay, okay! All right!

1094
01:14:45,954 --> 01:14:47,856
Come on, with me, come on!

1095
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,104
We'll take them to the bunker!

1096
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:54,966
Quickly!

1097
01:14:55,038 --> 01:14:56,038
Yeah!

1098
01:15:03,993 --> 01:15:13,640
[applause]

1099
01:15:14,355 --> 01:15:15,989
Eject storage device one.

1100
01:15:16,022 --> 01:15:18,755
Ejecting storage device one. Please wait.

1101
01:15:21,005 --> 01:15:22,939
Medium is now safe to remove.

1102
01:15:23,212 --> 01:15:24,723
Reset watchdog program.

1103
01:15:24,723 --> 01:15:26,247
Watchdog timer reset.

1104
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:28,262
Remaining time until shutdown

1105
01:15:28,325 --> 01:15:30,029
2 days, 23 hours

1106
01:15:30,185 --> 01:15:31,185
59 minutes.

1107
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:33,844
Delete command log and terminate session.

1108
01:15:33,916 --> 01:15:35,716
Goodbye, Brother Fireheart.

1109
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:38,319
My back!

1110
01:15:38,665 --> 01:15:41,405
Aah, I've been sitting in front
of this thing way too long.

1111
01:15:42,574 --> 01:15:44,584
Oh, I'm getting too old for this.

1112
01:15:46,795 --> 01:15:49,593
Oh, you must be Brother Fireheart.

1113
01:15:49,902 --> 01:15:54,453
Good thing you're still here, I
was afraid I was going to miss you.

1114
01:15:54,723 --> 01:15:58,418
Would you terribly mind
answering a few questions?

1115
01:15:58,455 --> 01:16:00,112
Who in the gods' name are you?

1116
01:16:00,465 --> 01:16:01,894
I don't think we've met before.

1117
01:16:01,966 --> 01:16:04,960
My name's Falconeye of Quail's Hollow.

1118
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:10,963
I've been ordered to the stronghold at
Great Overseer Ironwill's personal request.

1119
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:13,569
What is that in your hand?

1120
01:16:13,828 --> 01:16:15,206
It's a data crystal.

1121
01:16:15,502 --> 01:16:16,645
It's part of my work.

1122
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,961
And whatever Ironwill ordered you here for

1123
01:16:19,017 --> 01:16:21,932
I would very much appreciate
if you did it somewhere else.

1124
01:16:21,964 --> 01:16:22,676
Goodnight.

1125
01:16:22,701 --> 01:16:25,027
It will just take a minute, I promise.

1126
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:26,443
Please sit down.

1127
01:16:26,653 --> 01:16:28,104
I don't have time for this…

1128
01:16:28,282 --> 01:16:29,791
Oh, don't worry

1129
01:16:30,113 --> 01:16:32,714
you are going to have plenty of time soon.

1130
01:16:32,898 --> 01:16:33,858
What do you mean?

1131
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:35,531
It has come to our attention

1132
01:16:35,548 --> 01:16:39,428
that there has been an unusual
amount of irregularities at the stronghold

1133
01:16:39,726 --> 01:16:42,288
Human artifacts disappearing over night.

1134
01:16:42,336 --> 01:16:44,303
Inexplicable power surges.

1135
01:16:44,493 --> 01:16:46,799
Records that don't match.

1136
01:16:46,855 --> 01:16:48,426
And what do I have to do with it?

1137
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,830
I'm a scientist, not an accounting clerk.

1138
01:16:51,051 --> 01:16:52,471
A scientist!

1139
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:55,450
That's human word, isn't it?

1140
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:58,130
Oh I'm sorry if that confuses you, but yes

1141
01:16:58,348 --> 01:17:01,373
human artifacts and knowledge
are my field of expertise.

1142
01:17:01,477 --> 01:17:03,113
Now that's funny.

1143
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:06,757
We just caught a group of
outcasts in the forest at Serpent River

1144
01:17:06,773 --> 01:17:08,067
and you know what?

1145
01:17:08,361 --> 01:17:10,094
They talked just like you.

1146
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,525
And not only did they have their
pockets full of illegal human artifacts

1147
01:17:13,882 --> 01:17:17,079
they knew what they're
called, and how to use them.

1148
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:18,921
Well, maybe you should invite them.

1149
01:17:18,937 --> 01:17:20,637
It seems like we can learn from them.

1150
01:17:20,788 --> 01:17:24,984
"It seems to me more like one
of us has been teaching them.

1151
01:17:25,203 --> 01:17:29,809
We are the Keepers of the Light, and we
are the keepers of the ancient knowledge.

1152
01:17:29,842 --> 01:17:32,814
If they know something
only we should know

1153
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:35,660
that means we have a problem, doesn't it?

1154
01:17:35,755 --> 01:17:39,599
It means, someone
in our midst is a traitor.

1155
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:45,556
Now would you mind telling me
where you are taking that data crystal?

1156
01:17:45,557 --> 01:17:46,712
To my room.

1157
01:17:47,055 --> 01:17:49,655
Sometimes I take my work up to my room.

1158
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,420
And then what are you going to do with it

1159
01:17:51,452 --> 01:17:53,260
without a machine to read it?

1160
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,493
You know nothing about this technology!

1161
01:17:55,549 --> 01:17:56,883
Oh, I do.

1162
01:17:57,352 --> 01:17:59,693
Everything you wrote about it, in fact.

1163
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:03,542
I've been watching you for
many months, Brother Fireheart.

1164
01:18:03,614 --> 01:18:05,023
Studying your work.

1165
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:07,228
Your records. Your life.

1166
01:18:07,395 --> 01:18:10,136
I know where you were
born, where you grew up

1167
01:18:10,301 --> 01:18:12,461
what you did during your time in Coldlake

1168
01:18:12,633 --> 01:18:16,988
and I know the name of every
single commoner you fucked with.

1169
01:18:17,187 --> 01:18:20,369
How many bastard children
did you conceive, Fireheart?

1170
01:18:20,497 --> 01:18:21,213
How many?

1171
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,515
That is none of your goddamn business!

1172
01:18:23,527 --> 01:18:25,527
At least, thanks to the plague

1173
01:18:25,592 --> 01:18:28,430
you won't have to pay
much for child support.

1174
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:31,581
You filthy son of a pigrat!

1175
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,614
I could understand your
rage if I were making this up.

1176
01:18:34,904 --> 01:18:36,927
But I'm just merely stating the facts.

1177
01:18:37,094 --> 01:18:40,189
You seem to have a hard time
coming to terms with your own past.

1178
01:18:40,372 --> 01:18:43,151
Maybe you need to talk to someone.

1179
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:46,082
Maybe it's time to confess.

1180
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,755
Just let it all out.

1181
01:18:49,352 --> 01:18:50,352
Come on.

1182
01:18:50,687 --> 01:18:52,251
Relieve the rage!

1183
01:18:52,309 --> 01:18:54,222
There is nothing to confess.

1184
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:56,829
And funny enough, that's not even a lie.

1185
01:18:57,451 --> 01:19:01,129
Because I already know it's you who
has been leaking our sacred knowledge

1186
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:03,812
to the rebel underground
for all these years.

1187
01:19:03,837 --> 01:19:05,855
And I already know that
the rebel underground

1188
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:08,415
is about to launch an
attack against the stronghold

1189
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:11,635
using the very knowledge
and technology you gave them.

1190
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:15,119
There's indeed not much
left to confess, I'll give you that

1191
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:17,844
Except one thing.

1192
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,653
And what would that
be, Brother Know-It-all?

1193
01:19:20,717 --> 01:19:22,517
Since the day you came here

1194
01:19:22,764 --> 01:19:25,657
you've been checking out a
double dose of the shadow remedy.

1195
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:29,976
I checked all the logs against
the actual register of residents

1196
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:35,057
turns out that one of the names belongs
to a brother who's been dead for years.

1197
01:19:35,587 --> 01:19:38,531
There's only one reason
to check out two doses

1198
01:19:38,858 --> 01:19:42,012
To keep someone alive
who's not supposed to be alive.

1199
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:47,522
And I want you to tell
me who that someone is.

1200
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:50,527
Only over my cold dead body.

1201
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:52,860
[BRZZZZT]

1202
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,380
Well, all in due time, Brother Fireheart.

1203
01:19:55,531 --> 01:19:56,971
We'll see to that.

1204
01:19:57,529 --> 01:19:58,969
We'll see to that.

1205
01:20:07,179 --> 01:20:09,217
All right, this is it.

1206
01:20:09,526 --> 01:20:11,250
Entrance B-35.

1207
01:20:14,203 --> 01:20:15,883
Aaaaaand - it's open!

1208
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,376
I'll go in first and check it out.

1209
01:20:28,678 --> 01:20:32,237
The whole place is dark

1210
01:20:32,842 --> 01:20:33,842
Excellent.

1211
01:20:33,939 --> 01:20:35,872
We're going ahead as planned.

1212
01:20:36,109 --> 01:20:37,109
Follow me.

1213
01:20:42,397 --> 01:20:45,725
So far everything is exactly
as Fireheart promised.

1214
01:20:45,878 --> 01:20:48,244
That means we'll have about 10 minutes

1215
01:20:48,316 --> 01:20:52,020
to get to the 5 main control stations
before the power comes back on

1216
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,736
once we've disarmed the guards

1217
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:58,575
we'll round them up in the
old decontamination area and…

1218
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:00,341
Fireheart?

1219
01:21:00,788 --> 01:21:02,478
FUCK! IT'S A TRAP!

1220
01:21:04,148 --> 01:21:06,594
Don't touch the barrier!

1221
01:21:06,622 --> 01:21:08,565
[BRZZZZT]

1222
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,440
DO NOT MOVE!

1223
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,816
All right, Ironwill.

1224
01:21:15,023 --> 01:21:17,086
I know you're in here.

1225
01:21:17,793 --> 01:21:19,233
[evil laughter]

1226
01:21:21,038 --> 01:21:23,802
Congratulations, Stormrunner

1227
01:21:24,226 --> 01:21:25,744
you caught on quickly!

1228
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:27,650
But…

1229
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:29,410
a bit too late.

1230
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:34,141
Screw you, Ironwill!

1231
01:21:34,645 --> 01:21:36,619
How long has he been dead?

1232
01:21:37,382 --> 01:21:39,459
For about a month or so.

1233
01:21:39,952 --> 01:21:42,019
Sorry for scaring you like that

1234
01:21:42,172 --> 01:21:46,000
but he developed a bit of smell
so I put him outside.

1235
01:21:46,857 --> 01:21:48,377
Now drop your sword

1236
01:21:48,681 --> 01:21:51,576
or shall we shock the crap out of you?

1237
01:21:54,579 --> 01:21:55,579
Happy now?

1238
01:21:56,207 --> 01:21:57,207
Delighted!

1239
01:21:58,841 --> 01:22:02,821
You have been trouble for so many years.

1240
01:22:03,065 --> 01:22:06,182
Now you're finally in front of me

1241
01:22:06,614 --> 01:22:08,915
shitting your pants.

1242
01:22:10,046 --> 01:22:12,446
My day just couldn't get any better.

1243
01:22:12,706 --> 01:22:13,706
Oh wait!

1244
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,670
Actually it could!

1245
01:22:16,396 --> 01:22:17,411
[SNAP]

1246
01:22:17,436 --> 01:22:20,338
[crowd exasperated]

1247
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,373
[sinister laughter]

1248
01:22:22,844 --> 01:22:25,731
Now my day is perfect.

1249
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:30,259
Ahh, look at what has become
of your laughable leaders!

1250
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:35,510
Firehart! This is what happens to who
renounce the gods of the holy mountain!

1251
01:22:36,263 --> 01:22:37,703
Fireheart is dead!

1252
01:22:38,135 --> 01:22:40,084
Stormrunner is dead!

1253
01:22:40,386 --> 01:22:42,650
The rebellion is dead!

1254
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,401
Hand over your weapons!

1255
01:22:47,457 --> 01:22:49,391
The rebellion will never die!

1256
01:22:49,781 --> 01:22:52,110
We will fight to the last man!

1257
01:22:52,771 --> 01:22:58,228
So touching to see how you hold on
to that little dream of yours.

1258
01:22:58,626 --> 01:23:01,556
You think: just maybe

1259
01:23:02,135 --> 01:23:06,573
your brothers and sisters of Camp
Freedom will come to save your sorry hides?

1260
01:23:07,033 --> 01:23:10,700
Well, it breaks my heart to tell you

1261
01:23:10,803 --> 01:23:13,875
that Camp Freedom is no longer anything

1262
01:23:13,978 --> 01:23:17,558
more but a pile of smoldering ashes.

1263
01:23:18,138 --> 01:23:20,605
And so are your brothers and sisters!

1264
01:23:21,219 --> 01:23:23,508
Don't... Don't believe what he says!

1265
01:23:23,942 --> 01:23:26,209
He's just trying to demoralize us!

1266
01:23:26,854 --> 01:23:29,120
Maybe you will believe my witness.

1267
01:23:30,503 --> 01:23:32,883
The only survivor…

1268
01:23:35,075 --> 01:23:37,397
[crowd becomes louder]

1269
01:23:37,414 --> 01:23:39,749
[crying]

1270
01:23:42,567 --> 01:23:43,567
He's right.

1271
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:46,780
I saw the camp burn with my own eyes.

1272
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:48,709
Everyone is dead!

1273
01:23:49,085 --> 01:23:52,769
If you keep fighting,
you will all die for nothing!

1274
01:23:53,352 --> 01:23:54,364
Please!

1275
01:23:56,388 --> 01:23:59,494
There, I told you so.

1276
01:23:59,825 --> 01:24:03,194
A keeper always tells the truth!

1277
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:10,037
Then why don't you tell the people the
truth about the gods of the holy mountain?

1278
01:24:10,355 --> 01:24:13,330
And the dark plague and human technology?

1279
01:24:13,754 --> 01:24:15,830
How can you say you are telling the truth?

1280
01:24:16,914 --> 01:24:18,931
Knowledge is like fire.

1281
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:23,906
Used carefully, it can warm
you on a cold winter's night.

1282
01:24:24,502 --> 01:24:29,311
But if set free, the fire spreads
and destroys everything in its path.

1283
01:24:30,251 --> 01:24:33,784
There once was a great
civilization before ours.

1284
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:38,982
But the power of their knowledge had
become so strong that it destroyed them.

1285
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,396
Today, nothing is left
of them but ancient ruins.

1286
01:24:44,018 --> 01:24:48,434
It is the Keepers' purpose to prevent
that from ever happening again.

1287
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:52,526
The holy mountain is a hearth
of knowledge that we keep

1288
01:24:52,611 --> 01:24:57,411
so the people can bask in its
warmth without getting burned.

1289
01:24:58,606 --> 01:25:01,340
You may think yourselve as liberators

1290
01:25:01,585 --> 01:25:05,576
but in reality you are
just careless children

1291
01:25:05,775 --> 01:25:07,295
playing with fire.

1292
01:25:08,248 --> 01:25:11,312
For that, you should be pitied.

1293
01:25:12,418 --> 01:25:15,050
If you pity them, then show mercy!

1294
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:20,381
When the crib is burning,
who deserves mercy?

1295
01:25:20,897 --> 01:25:22,135
The flames

1296
01:25:22,658 --> 01:25:23,747
or the child?

1297
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:28,865
By your standards, I guess that would depend
whether the child has the plague or not.

1298
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,901
[baleful laughter]

1299
01:25:31,643 --> 01:25:34,924
There's truly some Keeper's
blood running through your veins.

1300
01:25:35,308 --> 01:25:38,878
I would be tempted to see if
you'd carry the flame of truth

1301
01:25:39,393 --> 01:25:42,293
if you weren't a traitor's
bastard, of course.

1302
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:45,435
Thank you very much, I'm sure.

1303
01:25:45,664 --> 01:25:48,348
Now what are you going to do with them?

1304
01:25:48,765 --> 01:25:50,832
Drown them in the nearest lake?

1305
01:25:51,253 --> 01:25:53,304
What a waste that would be.

1306
01:25:53,628 --> 01:25:56,845
No, they can serve a better purpose

1307
01:25:57,366 --> 01:26:01,903
they will be made examples of what
happens to betrayers of the Holy Mountain.

1308
01:26:02,389 --> 01:26:07,776
They will be tried and
executed in their own villages.

1309
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:11,217
[direful laughter, crossing into coughing]

1310
01:26:13,389 --> 01:26:16,477
You don't sound so well, Irownill.

1311
01:26:16,808 --> 01:26:21,167
You should get that checked by a
professional human miracle scientist

1312
01:26:21,315 --> 01:26:24,515
before your peers decide
you're threat to mankind.

1313
01:26:25,015 --> 01:26:26,992
Happens quicker than you think.

1314
01:26:27,121 --> 01:26:29,121
I know what I'm talking about.

1315
01:26:29,564 --> 01:26:30,324
No.

1316
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:35,644
No, Frostwind, you absolutely don't.

1317
01:26:36,126 --> 01:26:38,259
Come, and let me tell you

1318
01:26:38,471 --> 01:26:41,071
why you are on this side of the fence…

1319
01:26:42,018 --> 01:26:43,018
Follow me.

1320
01:26:43,238 --> 01:26:45,171
I need to show you something.

1321
01:26:47,036 --> 01:26:48,678
[bodeful laughter]

1322
01:26:53,296 --> 01:27:02,817
[applause]

1323
01:27:04,116 --> 01:27:06,328
Max, I really need to talk to you.

1324
01:27:06,368 --> 01:27:08,742
Jeff, sorry, I'm in the
middle of a phone call…

1325
01:27:08,802 --> 01:27:10,181
It's important.

1326
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,516
Uh, all right.

1327
01:27:11,775 --> 01:27:13,375
Can I call you back? Ok, thanks.

1328
01:27:14,727 --> 01:27:16,407
OK, Jeff. What's the matter?

1329
01:27:16,555 --> 01:27:19,313
We have got to stop this madness!

1330
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,325
-What happened?
-It doesn't work.

1331
01:27:21,432 --> 01:27:23,260
And it never will, and you know it.

1332
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:26,581
Goldberg's team started
another trial run of Strain C.

1333
01:27:26,661 --> 01:27:28,862
And this time it didn't just go wrong.

1334
01:27:28,922 --> 01:27:30,722
No, it went horribly wrong.

1335
01:27:30,863 --> 01:27:32,930
You know, Jeff, we don't force anybody.

1336
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:36,089
The subjects are all volunteers,
and they know the risks.

1337
01:27:36,281 --> 01:27:39,422
Someone has to make sacrifices
if we want humanity to prevail.

1338
01:27:39,524 --> 01:27:42,266
Oh, that's easy to say
if you weren't there.

1339
01:27:42,876 --> 01:27:45,037
It seemed to work for a minute or so

1340
01:27:45,062 --> 01:27:47,536
but then there was a glitch
in the communication matrix

1341
01:27:47,556 --> 01:27:49,186
and everything went out of control!

1342
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,326
Can you imagine what it looks like

1343
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:55,764
if a million nanites suddenly start
slicing randomly through a man's body?

1344
01:27:56,269 --> 01:28:00,296
It's the most disturbing thing I've
ever had to see in my entire life!

1345
01:28:00,695 --> 01:28:04,933
He was turned into a bloody pulp as if
someone had turned on a giant blender.

1346
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:07,207
All the while he was fully conscious.

1347
01:28:07,254 --> 01:28:08,786
And it didn't stop at that.

1348
01:28:08,899 --> 01:28:12,341
The medics jumped forward to help
him, and as soon as they touched him

1349
01:28:12,368 --> 01:28:14,215
the nanites entered their bodies.

1350
01:28:14,371 --> 01:28:16,936
They both lost their hands
before the safeguards kicked in

1351
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:18,785
and the swarm shut itself down.

1352
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:20,654
It was a goddamn massacre!

1353
01:28:20,826 --> 01:28:22,067
Huh, Jeff...

1354
01:28:22,907 --> 01:28:25,107
I'm so sorry you had to see this.

1355
01:28:25,471 --> 01:28:27,316
But what else are we supposed to do

1356
01:28:27,348 --> 01:28:29,704
if we ever want to go
back to the surface again?

1357
01:28:29,749 --> 01:28:31,960
I have no perfect solution, Max.

1358
01:28:32,251 --> 01:28:34,396
We're all just poking about in the fog.

1359
01:28:34,421 --> 01:28:37,266
But this technology was
designed to be part of a machine.

1360
01:28:37,456 --> 01:28:39,585
And a military killing machine, at that.

1361
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:42,674
It's a foolish idea to believe
you can somehow reprogram it

1362
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:45,407
to repair a human body instead of a tank.

1363
01:28:45,843 --> 01:28:49,449
What if the swarm doesn't shut down
the next time, and it wipes us all out?

1364
01:28:49,715 --> 01:28:50,715
Jeff.

1365
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:53,041
You do realize you need help, right?

1366
01:28:53,072 --> 01:28:54,512
No, you need help!

1367
01:28:54,857 --> 01:28:57,723
This isn't ethical! It's not even rational!

1368
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,556
Please, Jeff, calm down.

1369
01:28:59,587 --> 01:29:03,427
You should go and see the counsellor.
And take a few weeks off, OK?

1370
01:29:03,474 --> 01:29:05,154
Take a few weeks off?

1371
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:09,186
Oh no. I'll tell you what I do: I quit!

1372
01:29:09,498 --> 01:29:11,504
And let the geneticists win the race?

1373
01:29:11,544 --> 01:29:14,248
What, you think this is
some sort of competition?

1374
01:29:14,398 --> 01:29:16,818
Geneticists against Nanotechnologists?

1375
01:29:16,838 --> 01:29:18,453
And if they win, we lose?

1376
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:22,393
Has it ever occured to you, that
if either team wins, nobody loses?

1377
01:29:22,495 --> 01:29:25,331
But if we wipe out our
own crew, we all lose!

1378
01:29:25,367 --> 01:29:28,878
Look, Jeff, I don't know about you,
but I want the real humanity back

1379
01:29:29,033 --> 01:29:32,457
A civilization of actual, genuine humans.

1380
01:29:32,812 --> 01:29:35,212
Not some tarnished, diluted chimera.

1381
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:38,687
What is life worth if we no
longer know, who we are?

1382
01:29:39,104 --> 01:29:40,718
There is only one human race

1383
01:29:40,743 --> 01:29:45,085
and if I had to sacrifice my
own life to save it, I would do so.

1384
01:29:45,621 --> 01:29:49,181
If you have a problem with that,
you have no place in this organisation.

1385
01:29:49,379 --> 01:29:51,402
The old times are gone, Max.

1386
01:29:51,488 --> 01:29:53,214
And nothing will ever bring them back.

1387
01:29:53,658 --> 01:29:56,904
Evolution knows only one
direction, and that is forward.

1388
01:29:56,969 --> 01:29:58,787
*sigh* So you're changing camps?

1389
01:29:58,867 --> 01:30:01,136
Yes. And I'm sorry, Max.

1390
01:30:01,269 --> 01:30:05,807
I used to believe in nanotechnology,
but today's incident has opened my eyes.

1391
01:30:05,893 --> 01:30:09,140
If I have the choice between
creating new life, and taking it away

1392
01:30:09,518 --> 01:30:10,920
I know what's right.

1393
01:30:11,145 --> 01:30:13,412
You'll have my papers by tomorrow.

1394
01:30:13,869 --> 01:30:15,149
Good night, Max.

1395
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:24,502
[repeated banging]

1396
01:30:24,588 --> 01:30:26,196
[creaky door opens]

1397
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,300
Come in everybody

1398
01:30:33,573 --> 01:30:37,904
the keepers don't know about this entrance,
so we should be safe here for a while.

1399
01:30:38,235 --> 01:30:40,545
Where… are we?

1400
01:30:41,994 --> 01:30:43,813
We're inside the holy mountain.

1401
01:30:44,246 --> 01:30:47,514
The Keepers' stronghold at the
summit is just a very small part

1402
01:30:47,653 --> 01:30:50,120
of a much larger underground complex.

1403
01:30:50,955 --> 01:30:53,689
This part was sealed off a long time ago.

1404
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,694
It's the last place
they'll be expecting us.

1405
01:30:57,282 --> 01:30:58,282
Amazing.

1406
01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:01,343
And all this was all built by the humans?

1407
01:31:03,048 --> 01:31:04,048
Yes.

1408
01:31:04,557 --> 01:31:09,115
Unlike the ruins you can find outside, this
place here was built to last centuries.

1409
01:31:09,544 --> 01:31:12,797
This place was once a
refuge for thousands of people

1410
01:31:13,088 --> 01:31:15,499
the final remains of a dying civilization.

1411
01:31:15,671 --> 01:31:17,738
How do you know about all this?

1412
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:22,520
Fireheart studied the documents the
humans have left behind in this stronghold.

1413
01:31:22,923 --> 01:31:27,732
He shared centuries of history with us,
so we could use it to build a new world.

1414
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:31,319
Ahh, can we save the history
lessons for another time?

1415
01:31:31,548 --> 01:31:33,627
All we had went up in flames anyway!

1416
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,395
That makes spreading the
word even more important!

1417
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,693
You know what's important to me right now?

1418
01:31:38,899 --> 01:31:40,901
All my friends are dead!
That's important!

1419
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:45,092
I'm sorry. I can't turn back time.

1420
01:31:45,436 --> 01:31:49,018
I never liked the idea to take
the Keepers' Stronghold by force.

1421
01:31:49,498 --> 01:31:53,115
I think we should have put more
effort in actually educating the people!

1422
01:31:53,612 --> 01:31:58,092
But it was Stormrunner's decision
to make - he was the leader, not me.

1423
01:31:58,313 --> 01:32:01,348
Ah! Aha! And now you're in charge?

1424
01:32:01,532 --> 01:32:03,212
Are you ready to lead us?

1425
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:05,629
He's the one who saved your sorry ass.

1426
01:32:05,654 --> 01:32:06,788
Show some respect!

1427
01:32:07,089 --> 01:32:07,844
Fuck you!

1428
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:11,001
My friends are dead, and
he is all words, and no action!

1429
01:32:12,676 --> 01:32:15,573
Want action? Here!
Have some action!

1430
01:32:16,172 --> 01:32:18,388
Arrrgh! COME HERE YOU BASTARD!

1431
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,079
-I will fucking kill you!
-Hey!

1432
01:32:21,229 --> 01:32:22,229
Hey!

1433
01:32:22,813 --> 01:32:24,104
Guys, er...

1434
01:32:24,814 --> 01:32:26,414
Hey, sto - stop it!

1435
01:32:39,488 --> 01:32:41,598
Will you CHILL THE FUCK OUT!

1436
01:32:41,635 --> 01:32:43,126
Stop fighting!

1437
01:32:46,214 --> 01:32:47,254
Listen!

1438
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:49,810
They were my friends, too!

1439
01:32:49,941 --> 01:32:52,465
Do you even realize what
happened here tonight?

1440
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,008
Stormrunner is dead!

1441
01:32:54,094 --> 01:32:57,077
We are on our own! We must stand together!

1442
01:32:57,331 --> 01:32:58,882
I'm sorry. It's just…

1443
01:32:59,184 --> 01:33:01,196
*cough* it's all been a bit too much.

1444
01:33:08,247 --> 01:33:10,450
I'm the one who needs to be sorry here.

1445
01:33:10,868 --> 01:33:12,377
If we hadn't come to your camp

1446
01:33:12,397 --> 01:33:15,331
I'm sure things would have
turned out quite differently.

1447
01:33:16,326 --> 01:33:18,793
Actually, I'm very glad you found us.

1448
01:33:19,074 --> 01:33:21,569
If there's anyone to blame, then it's me.

1449
01:33:22,182 --> 01:33:23,182
*sigh*

1450
01:33:23,538 --> 01:33:26,778
I had all the puzzle pieces,
and I knew something was wrong, but

1451
01:33:26,937 --> 01:33:31,384
by the time I figured it out, Ironwill
was already burning down the camp.

1452
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:33,730
By the time you figured WHAT out?

1453
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:37,739
Why Frostwind never showed any
symptoms of the plague all these years!

1454
01:33:37,872 --> 01:33:40,932
It was so obvious, but I didn't see it.

1455
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:43,070
In order for her to survive

1456
01:33:43,162 --> 01:33:47,868
Fireheart must have some...
somehow he has supplied her…

1457
01:33:48,688 --> 01:33:49,819
or her mother...

1458
01:33:49,853 --> 01:33:51,554
with the radiation remedy.

1459
01:33:51,932 --> 01:33:53,823
Ra... Radiation… what?

1460
01:33:54,156 --> 01:33:57,387
Radiation damages the body's DNA.

1461
01:33:57,412 --> 01:33:59,644
But the humans found a
way to repair the damage

1462
01:33:59,684 --> 01:34:02,608
using swarms of specially
programmed nanites that…

1463
01:34:02,648 --> 01:34:06,264
What Brushie here is trying to say is
that the Keepers have a huge machine

1464
01:34:06,289 --> 01:34:08,022
that spits out little green pills.

1465
01:34:08,089 --> 01:34:10,777
And if you take one every
week you won't get the plague.

1466
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:12,396
Exactly.

1467
01:34:13,027 --> 01:34:16,776
Frostwind suddenly getting the plague
means she no longer got the medicine.

1468
01:34:17,094 --> 01:34:21,610
And that in turn means that something
must have happened to her father!

1469
01:34:23,179 --> 01:34:24,692
I could have warned Stormrunner, but it

1470
01:34:24,717 --> 01:34:28,045
totally didn't occur to me
something could be wrong!

1471
01:34:29,132 --> 01:34:30,812
It's... It's alright Brushie.

1472
01:34:31,239 --> 01:34:33,353
We all try to do our best - it's

1473
01:34:33,473 --> 01:34:35,555
the only thing we can do, right?

1474
01:34:37,456 --> 01:34:39,612
Do you think Frostwind is still alive?

1475
01:34:40,056 --> 01:34:43,192
Yes. I saw Ironwill
carrying her out of the camp.

1476
01:34:43,518 --> 01:34:45,273
She must have something he wants.

1477
01:34:45,326 --> 01:34:48,608
So... So she could be
in this very building?

1478
01:34:50,075 --> 01:34:51,075
Maybe.

1479
01:34:51,335 --> 01:34:52,335
Maybe not.

1480
01:34:52,918 --> 01:34:57,320
But you can't just walk upstairs from here
and burst into the Keepers' living room.

1481
01:34:57,526 --> 01:34:59,977
-But...
-The inhabited area is pretty well

1482
01:35:00,077 --> 01:35:03,144
sealed off. And even if you'd find a way

1483
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:06,733
they have ways of detecting
intruders you can't even imagine.

1484
01:35:06,773 --> 01:35:10,226
But we can't just sit here
and do nothing, either!

1485
01:35:10,557 --> 01:35:13,533
Frostwind might have only
a few days more to live!

1486
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:16,052
You said that the keepers have a cure.

1487
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:18,488
If all we need is a handful of pills

1488
01:35:18,502 --> 01:35:20,308
-then we - we just might…
[laughter]

1489
01:35:21,490 --> 01:35:23,290
What's so funny about that?

1490
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:29,316
The machine that produces
the shadow remedy is

1491
01:35:29,336 --> 01:35:33,180
the single most well protected
thing in the entire Stronghold.

1492
01:35:33,385 --> 01:35:35,322
The holy of the holies.

1493
01:35:35,772 --> 01:35:37,371
What makes it so important?

1494
01:35:37,379 --> 01:35:39,221
The Keepers don't GET the plague!

1495
01:35:39,368 --> 01:35:41,237
Or do they?

1496
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:44,677
Here's a little history lessen for you

1497
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:50,235
The radiation that causes the
dark plague is the very same thing

1498
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:52,699
that nearly wiped out humanity.

1499
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:56,688
If humans still existed, and
you would put one of them

1500
01:35:56,722 --> 01:35:59,255
in the middle of Ferndale marketplaces

1501
01:35:59,535 --> 01:36:01,755
he would get sick and die.

1502
01:36:02,088 --> 01:36:03,688
But we're not human!

1503
01:36:04,112 --> 01:36:09,274
Oh yes. Yes, we are, my friend.

1504
01:36:09,441 --> 01:36:11,485
-Especially the Keepers.
-What?

1505
01:36:13,512 --> 01:36:14,637
Look around.

1506
01:36:16,083 --> 01:36:17,363
What do you see?

1507
01:36:17,971 --> 01:36:20,342
I see… cages …

1508
01:36:21,185 --> 01:36:25,217
Your own ancestors might once
have lived in one of these cages.

1509
01:36:25,438 --> 01:36:27,452
We're the creation of g...

1510
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:29,839
We're not the creation of gods.

1511
01:36:30,311 --> 01:36:32,518
We're the creation of humans, my friend.

1512
01:36:32,909 --> 01:36:38,221
We're surrogates, bred to live in a world
no longer inhabitable for their own kind.

1513
01:36:38,513 --> 01:36:40,846
The Keepers are our own prototypes.

1514
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,767
They have human blood.

1515
01:36:42,983 --> 01:36:45,283
-What?
-They are not immune to the radiation

1516
01:36:45,356 --> 01:36:47,657
and without the remedy, they will die.

1517
01:36:48,001 --> 01:36:49,001
All of them.

1518
01:36:49,539 --> 01:36:53,415
Guess why they are not allowed
to breed with us commoners.

1519
01:36:53,694 --> 01:36:57,789
And guess why they're protecting
the holy mountain like life itself!

1520
01:36:59,372 --> 01:37:01,061
Wow. That is…

1521
01:37:01,501 --> 01:37:03,765
just... wow.

1522
01:37:04,043 --> 01:37:05,723
Yeah, it floored me too.

1523
01:37:05,861 --> 01:37:07,756
The first 20 times I heard it.

1524
01:37:08,571 --> 01:37:09,571
Sparky!

1525
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,214
*sigh* Alright. Fine.

1526
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:14,745
I understand now what I'm up against. But

1527
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:15,991
you know what?

1528
01:37:16,416 --> 01:37:19,863
I once lost a loved one just
because I was too afraid

1529
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:21,469
to take things into my own hands, and

1530
01:37:21,751 --> 01:37:25,935
I'd rather die trying than
make that same mistake again.

1531
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:28,150
I must go.

1532
01:37:28,624 --> 01:37:30,299
We can't come with you.

1533
01:37:30,706 --> 01:37:31,746
I understand.

1534
01:37:31,956 --> 01:37:34,900
But please, at least
tell me how to get there.

1535
01:37:35,912 --> 01:37:36,912
*sigh*

1536
01:37:38,023 --> 01:37:39,169
All right.

1537
01:37:39,872 --> 01:37:41,701
It was nice knowing you, my friend.

1538
01:37:44,122 --> 01:37:52,400
[applause]

1539
01:37:59,385 --> 01:38:01,933
Hrgsnm. Hrgmbrmbl. Hnnnnnrrrrgs.

1540
01:38:02,223 --> 01:38:03,571
Hrrrrrz. Uhhhh.

1541
01:38:04,247 --> 01:38:05,946
Hrrrrrr. Hrgggr. Hnnggs.

1542
01:38:06,487 --> 01:38:07,148
Uh-oh...

1543
01:38:07,175 --> 01:38:09,578
Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

1544
01:38:09,624 --> 01:38:12,414
AAAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHH!

1545
01:38:13,817 --> 01:38:15,655
Oh shit ohhh

1546
01:38:15,733 --> 01:38:16,733
Oohhhhh!

1547
01:38:17,162 --> 01:38:18,162
Aahhhhh!

1548
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,261
Ouch!.. Ohh..

1549
01:38:21,709 --> 01:38:23,541
By the gods, that hurt.. Ohhh..

1550
01:38:32,416 --> 01:38:37,089
I see now why this wasn't the
rebels' preferred invasion route.

1551
01:38:38,189 --> 01:38:39,293
*sigh* Wow!

1552
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:40,754
Woooow!

1553
01:38:41,334 --> 01:38:45,942
This looks so much nicer than the
prayer room of the chapel in Ferndale!

1554
01:38:46,743 --> 01:38:48,996
Everything's so bright and beautiful!

1555
01:38:50,493 --> 01:38:53,903
I wonder what kind of
ceremonies they conduct in here.

1556
01:39:06,809 --> 01:39:08,859
Oo-oooh drat

1557
01:39:10,029 --> 01:39:11,387
someone coming!

1558
01:39:11,423 --> 01:39:13,896
Why can't I keep my
god damned mouth shut...

1559
01:39:14,135 --> 01:39:15,489
All right, over there!

1560
01:39:16,363 --> 01:39:20,192
[creaky door opens and closes]

1561
01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:27,909
Dumm dee dumm dee dumm dumm.

1562
01:39:28,726 --> 01:39:29,726
Hmmm...

1563
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:33,138
I could have sworn I heard a noise.

1564
01:39:35,507 --> 01:39:36,547
Eh

1565
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:38,760
whatever.

1566
01:39:39,552 --> 01:39:42,496
At least there's still
time for some practice.

1567
01:39:44,745 --> 01:39:48,076
One, two

1568
01:39:48,963 --> 01:39:50,060
three!

1569
01:39:50,636 --> 01:39:51,636
four.

1570
01:39:52,026 --> 01:40:04,134
[organ music playing]

1571
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:06,177
[creaky door opens again]

1572
01:40:11,556 --> 01:40:12,556
[BLAM]

1573
01:40:17,828 --> 01:40:19,566
Sorry my friend

1574
01:40:21,403 --> 01:40:24,018
Sorry, but I need this right now

1575
01:40:24,045 --> 01:40:25,217
c'mere...

1576
01:40:33,615 --> 01:40:34,615
*gasp*

1577
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,490
Let me borrow that cloak for a moment.

1578
01:40:37,887 --> 01:40:40,243
Wahahaha!

1579
01:40:40,275 --> 01:40:44,307
Look at me, I'm Brother Riversong,
Avenger of the dispossessed, hah!

1580
01:40:45,449 --> 01:40:46,449
*sigh*

1581
01:40:46,655 --> 01:40:48,698
Now what I'm going to do with you?

1582
01:40:53,771 --> 01:40:54,771
All right!

1583
01:41:08,713 --> 01:41:10,513
Have a nice day, my friend.

1584
01:41:13,579 --> 01:41:15,363
[creaky door tries to open again]

1585
01:41:15,390 --> 01:41:17,125
Ooh nononono!

1586
01:41:17,436 --> 01:41:20,290
You're supposed to stay… inside!

1587
01:41:26,237 --> 01:41:27,658
No, that's won't work

1588
01:41:36,974 --> 01:41:38,343
Ahh! There.

1589
01:41:40,896 --> 01:41:42,298
Piece of cake, hah!

1590
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:48,028
Now let's see... See
if I can find Frostwind.

1591
01:41:48,608 --> 01:41:51,368
Shouldn't be too hard,
now that I'm in disguise.

1592
01:42:06,703 --> 01:42:08,779
[muffled voices outside]

1593
01:42:37,092 --> 01:42:40,393
Dear Brothers and Sisters! *coughs*

1594
01:42:40,981 --> 01:42:44,440
Welcome to today's morning service.

1595
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:47,972
Praised be the gods of the holy mountain!

1596
01:42:48,642 --> 01:42:52,127
[Everyone] "As it was, and always will be!"

1597
01:42:53,391 --> 01:42:58,225
Head Overseer Ironwill has *coughs*
called me up from my home village

1598
01:42:58,687 --> 01:43:03,384
to temporarily serve as a
replacement for Brother Swiftfoot

1599
01:43:04,277 --> 01:43:07,655
whose health sadly has deteriorated so much

1600
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:10,399
that he can't be with us here today.

1601
01:43:10,968 --> 01:43:13,635
May the gods be with him and his family!

1602
01:43:13,852 --> 01:43:16,912
[Everyone] "As it was, and always will be!"

1603
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:20,861
Before we begin with the festive part

1604
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:28,265
Overseer Ironwill asked me to give you
a few updates about the current situation.

1605
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,903
We... Mhhhm. Sorry.

1606
01:43:35,129 --> 01:43:39,211
We still have not been able
to restart the main light core

1607
01:43:39,629 --> 01:43:44,780
which means that the production
of the shadow remedy is still halted.

1608
01:43:45,323 --> 01:43:48,267
Our best researchers
are working on a solution

1609
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:53,685
but until then we can only see it
as the gods' will

1610
01:43:54,118 --> 01:43:55,936
to test our faith.

1611
01:43:56,690 --> 01:44:00,050
[Everyone] "As it was, and always will be!"

1612
01:44:01,047 --> 01:44:06,756
Without the remedy, *coughs* the
darkness within us grows every day

1613
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:11,924
and the Overseers are calling up
Brothers and Sisters from all villages

1614
01:44:12,148 --> 01:44:16,288
who are still of better
health to help us out.

1615
01:44:18,967 --> 01:44:22,167
Our healers have opened
up an extra basement level

1616
01:44:22,404 --> 01:44:25,204
which will serve as a temporary infirmary.

1617
01:44:25,771 --> 01:44:30,540
If anyone in your family
shows any signs of the plague

1618
01:44:31,055 --> 01:44:33,470
please take them down to level 12

1619
01:44:33,665 --> 01:44:35,798
and let the healers take a look.

1620
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:38,677
Any questions?

1621
01:44:39,474 --> 01:44:41,041
Yes, please?

1622
01:44:41,258 --> 01:44:45,239
The scriptures say that the light
core is driven by the power of the gods!

1623
01:44:45,292 --> 01:44:47,784
Does that mean that the
gods have forsaken us?

1624
01:44:47,804 --> 01:44:49,868
No, no, of course not.

1625
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:55,203
It is hard to explain
without getting technical

1626
01:44:55,780 --> 01:44:59,712
but according to Overseer Ironwill

1627
01:45:00,122 --> 01:45:03,623
it is not that the gods'
power is no longer there

1628
01:45:03,994 --> 01:45:08,142
but the machinery that
controls it has been locked down

1629
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:10,862
so we can no longer use it.

1630
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:14,562
Is it true that the lockdown
was Brother Fireheart's doing?

1631
01:45:14,959 --> 01:45:19,084
Yes. He was a servant of the darkness.

1632
01:45:19,674 --> 01:45:21,963
But don't despair.

1633
01:45:22,645 --> 01:45:26,634
Where there is a
lock, there is also a key

1634
01:45:27,038 --> 01:45:28,971
Fireheart's bastard daughter.

1635
01:45:29,691 --> 01:45:32,358
Ironwill is interrogating her right now.

1636
01:45:32,714 --> 01:45:36,083
So let's pray to the gods
of the holy mountain!

1637
01:45:36,547 --> 01:45:39,513
[Everyone] "As it was, and always will be!"

1638
01:45:40,419 --> 01:45:43,321
Let's sing the song of the uplifting

1639
01:45:43,758 --> 01:45:47,398
chant book page 437.

1640
01:45:48,192 --> 01:45:49,718
Music, please!

1641
01:45:52,654 --> 01:45:54,155
What are you waiting for?

1642
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:56,964
I said, Music, please!

1643
01:45:58,772 --> 01:46:02,824
[organ cacophony]

1644
01:46:03,691 --> 01:46:06,224
By the gods, stop that dreadful noise!

1645
01:46:06,408 --> 01:46:08,541
What the hell is wrong with you?

1646
01:46:09,378 --> 01:46:11,627
*cough* *cough* *cough*

1647
01:46:12,084 --> 01:46:15,886
Oh um eh I'm... I'm so sorry …

1648
01:46:16,143 --> 01:46:17,823
I have the dark plague…

1649
01:46:18,490 --> 01:46:19,530
and the flu…

1650
01:46:20,008 --> 01:46:21,288
and the measles.

1651
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:22,870
At the same time!

1652
01:46:24,191 --> 01:46:26,224
I can barely see. Or hear.

1653
01:46:26,779 --> 01:46:27,779
Or smell.

1654
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,130
Or taste.

1655
01:46:29,376 --> 01:46:32,602
For goodness sake, then
why are you still here?

1656
01:46:32,778 --> 01:46:35,178
Get your tail down to the infirmary!

1657
01:46:37,472 --> 01:46:40,159
Oh yes, *cough* *cough*

1658
01:46:40,497 --> 01:46:43,441
thank you, Brother
Strongarm, for letting me go!

1659
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:45,970
I would have gone to the infirmary

1660
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:48,410
but I didn't want to disappoint you.

1661
01:46:48,587 --> 01:46:51,595
It's OK. Just - just go!

1662
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,581
I tried my best, but it wasn't good enough.

1663
01:46:55,608 --> 01:46:58,353
-Don't - don't worry!
-Music has been always

1664
01:46:58,374 --> 01:46:59,581
my greatest passion and…

1665
01:46:59,645 --> 01:47:00,680
[THUD]

1666
01:47:01,378 --> 01:47:02,296
Wait!

1667
01:47:02,336 --> 01:47:04,936
Stop right there and show me your face.

1668
01:47:06,564 --> 01:47:07,564
Um...

1669
01:47:12,688 --> 01:47:13,816
Hello eh...

1670
01:47:14,409 --> 01:47:15,745
RIVERSONG!

1671
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:19,135
-Eh...
-WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! SEIZE HIM!!

1672
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,587
-Please don't - Aaaaaagh!
[BRZZZZT]

1673
01:47:24,430 --> 01:47:30,747
[applause]

1674
01:47:30,913 --> 01:47:32,956
[phone ringing]

1675
01:47:33,003 --> 01:47:34,003
*yawn*

1676
01:47:34,853 --> 01:47:36,100
What the hell…

1677
01:47:36,614 --> 01:47:38,770
This better be important!

1678
01:47:42,972 --> 01:47:43,972
Yes?

1679
01:47:44,099 --> 01:47:46,677
Uh, sorry to wake you
up, Paul, but it seems

1680
01:47:46,684 --> 01:47:48,776
we have a problem with
the power distribution.

1681
01:47:49,131 --> 01:47:52,181
Aha. And what is so important about that

1682
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:55,093
that you need to wake me
up in the middle of the night?

1683
01:47:55,285 --> 01:47:58,332
I can't fix your power,
call a goddamn electrician.

1684
01:47:58,411 --> 01:48:01,280
Well, that's what we did. But
it's not a regular power outage.

1685
01:48:01,353 --> 01:48:03,717
We've lost contact to
the entire biolab section.

1686
01:48:03,917 --> 01:48:07,383
All five floors went dark at the
same time, including the backup power.

1687
01:48:07,537 --> 01:48:10,202
Also, the firedoors have
closed, so we can't get in.

1688
01:48:10,279 --> 01:48:11,279
Shit!

1689
01:48:11,466 --> 01:48:12,959
That's not supposed to happen!

1690
01:48:13,197 --> 01:48:16,696
Ahh... Any explosions,
fire, or other incidents?

1691
01:48:16,796 --> 01:48:19,464
No. We checked the surveillance
cameras… Nothing to see.

1692
01:48:19,517 --> 01:48:21,376
And no unusual environmental readings.

1693
01:48:21,399 --> 01:48:24,829
It was all quiet and normal, and all of a
sudden, all the circuit breakers tripped.

1694
01:48:24,862 --> 01:48:26,741
How many people are still in the lab?

1695
01:48:26,801 --> 01:48:29,326
Nobody. Security had
just finished their round.

1696
01:48:29,346 --> 01:48:31,255
5 minutes later, and they'd be trapped.

1697
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,580
What the fuck is going on there?

1698
01:48:33,919 --> 01:48:37,439
*sigh* We're talking about at
least 3 independant systems here

1699
01:48:37,555 --> 01:48:39,958
all redundant - especially life support.

1700
01:48:40,051 --> 01:48:41,765
This can't be a coincidence.

1701
01:48:41,812 --> 01:48:43,945
Do what you can to get in there.

1702
01:48:44,089 --> 01:48:47,139
No shit, guess what we've
been trying all that time.

1703
01:48:47,306 --> 01:48:48,306
Oh wait…

1704
01:48:48,956 --> 01:48:49,956
Uh what?

1705
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:51,390
Uh... The...

1706
01:48:52,754 --> 01:48:55,786
Jeff? It seems power is
coming back. Hang on.

1707
01:48:56,834 --> 01:48:58,992
And reset the goddamn fire doors!

1708
01:48:59,631 --> 01:49:01,228
OK, doors are opening.

1709
01:49:01,269 --> 01:49:03,556
Wait… what's… shit! CLOSE THE DOORS!

1710
01:49:03,595 --> 01:49:06,764
CLOSE THE DOORS! ARRGH!

1711
01:49:07,565 --> 01:49:08,565
Paul?

1712
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:09,899
PAUL?

1713
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:11,544
Shit!

1714
01:49:13,396 --> 01:49:14,923
Connection refused.

1715
01:49:15,043 --> 01:49:17,920
Oh no-no-no what the
fuck is going on there?!

1716
01:49:18,335 --> 01:49:19,928
[alarm]

1717
01:49:20,088 --> 01:49:23,272
The evacuation alarm. Oh, may god help us.

1718
01:49:24,034 --> 01:49:26,476
I knew this wouldn't end well, I knew it.

1719
01:49:26,780 --> 01:49:28,756
I got to get my envirosuit…. I….

1720
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:29,795
AAARGH!

1721
01:49:30,349 --> 01:49:35,155
Bloody... Oh my god, Francis, you
nearly scared the living shit out of me.

1722
01:49:35,182 --> 01:49:37,417
Why do you always sneak up on me like that?

1723
01:49:37,493 --> 01:49:41,093
I'm sorry for not being as
noisy as your kind is, Master.

1724
01:49:41,127 --> 01:49:44,607
Well, very funny. Something
went wrong in the biolab

1725
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:47,641
we need to get to the surface.
Have you seen my envirosuit?

1726
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:49,830
Right over here, Master.

1727
01:49:50,099 --> 01:49:51,099
Wa... what?

1728
01:49:51,761 --> 01:49:54,697
What did you do to my
envirosuit? It's… torn to pieces!

1729
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:57,898
And … what are you doing with that knife?

1730
01:49:58,153 --> 01:50:02,663
Today is the beginning of a new age.

1731
01:50:02,798 --> 01:50:05,336
Francis, what are you talking about?

1732
01:50:05,535 --> 01:50:07,922
It was me, who gave you gift of life!

1733
01:50:08,022 --> 01:50:12,327
I raised you, like a son, I
fed you, I taught you to walk

1734
01:50:12,426 --> 01:50:16,842
I taught you to speak - is this how
you are going to thank me for it?

1735
01:50:17,462 --> 01:50:19,529
Like your son, is what you say.

1736
01:50:19,773 --> 01:50:22,190
Like a slave, is what you mean.

1737
01:50:22,436 --> 01:50:24,717
I wanted to believe we're family.

1738
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:27,674
I wanted to believe you care about us.

1739
01:50:28,032 --> 01:50:31,465
But then, why did I
have to call you Master?

1740
01:50:31,592 --> 01:50:35,377
From now on, there will
no longer be a master.

1741
01:50:37,346 --> 01:50:39,026
You can call me Jeff.

1742
01:50:39,154 --> 01:50:41,464
Listen to me, "Jeff".

1743
01:50:41,696 --> 01:50:46,733
Even if I look a lot like the cute little
kitten in that old family photo on your desk

1744
01:50:46,832 --> 01:50:48,381
I'm not stupid.

1745
01:50:48,468 --> 01:50:49,741
None of us are.

1746
01:50:49,788 --> 01:50:54,404
Did you really expect we wouldn't find
out how to use your fancy machines?

1747
01:50:54,484 --> 01:50:57,751
Did you really think you
could hide your plans from us?

1748
01:50:58,641 --> 01:51:00,575
I've been reading your emails

1749
01:51:00,716 --> 01:51:03,541
and I know what fate you
had in mind for our kind

1750
01:51:03,561 --> 01:51:05,458
now that we're obsolete.

1751
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:07,983
You want us destroyed.

1752
01:51:08,169 --> 01:51:10,292
Every single one of us.

1753
01:51:10,683 --> 01:51:13,642
But it wasn't my idea! It's
an order by the commander!

1754
01:51:13,867 --> 01:51:15,938
He's a firm believer in nanotechnology

1755
01:51:15,965 --> 01:51:20,481
and now that the radiation cure works, he
ordered the end of all genetic experiments!

1756
01:51:20,934 --> 01:51:23,601
The genetic experiment begs to disagree!

1757
01:51:23,756 --> 01:51:25,852
I … I even fought for you!

1758
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:28,782
I tried to convince him
to let you live, honestly!

1759
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:31,449
Please, don't kill me! I'm your friend!

1760
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:35,654
If you really were my friend,
you would have warned me, Jeff.

1761
01:51:35,887 --> 01:51:37,516
But you didn't.

1762
01:51:37,669 --> 01:51:39,639
You're all the same.

1763
01:51:39,898 --> 01:51:41,795
You cannot be trusted.

1764
01:51:41,816 --> 01:51:43,502
No… NO!

1765
01:51:43,803 --> 01:51:44,803
[SLASH]

1766
01:51:46,191 --> 01:51:52,006
This is the new age. Your
kind no longer rules this place.

1767
01:52:00,117 --> 01:52:01,797
[electric door opens]

1768
01:52:01,906 --> 01:52:05,175
Welcome to the inner
sanctum of the Stronghold.

1769
01:52:05,665 --> 01:52:08,794
Only a chosen few
ever get to see this place.

1770
01:52:09,392 --> 01:52:11,173
I'm honored… *coughs*

1771
01:52:12,476 --> 01:52:14,703
Please, take a seat.

1772
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:23,677
Now what do you want from me, Ironwill?

1773
01:52:24,444 --> 01:52:29,954
Your father did something terrible,
and you are the only one who can stop it.

1774
01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:32,140
My father…?

1775
01:52:33,061 --> 01:52:35,928
This is the place your father used to work.

1776
01:52:36,524 --> 01:52:40,172
That huge thing over there
is called the main light core.

1777
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:43,145
It harnesses the power of the gods

1778
01:52:43,481 --> 01:52:46,245
and like almost everything
made inside the stronghold

1779
01:52:46,557 --> 01:52:50,744
it's controlled by some
kind of artificial brain.

1780
01:52:51,347 --> 01:52:56,786
Brother Fireheart was our most valuable
expert on this kind of human technology.

1781
01:52:57,022 --> 01:53:00,017
You mean, before you killed him, right?

1782
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:02,249
He brought that upon himself!

1783
01:53:02,702 --> 01:53:05,724
He gave away our
holiest secrets to the rebels

1784
01:53:05,890 --> 01:53:08,090
and of course we had to stop him.

1785
01:53:08,376 --> 01:53:11,394
The power of the gods is
mighty enough to wipe out all life

1786
01:53:11,421 --> 01:53:12,876
from the face of earth.

1787
01:53:13,268 --> 01:53:15,268
If it got into the wrong hands

1788
01:53:15,401 --> 01:53:18,316
that could mean the end of our world.

1789
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:21,168
My father just wanted us to be free!

1790
01:53:21,334 --> 01:53:24,342
A freedom paid for with
the blood of innocents!

1791
01:53:24,717 --> 01:53:27,981
When he was still alive,
your father set up a trap.

1792
01:53:28,651 --> 01:53:31,957
He programmed the artificial
brain that controls the light core

1793
01:53:32,017 --> 01:53:37,808
to shut itself down unless he
personally delivers a special code word

1794
01:53:37,935 --> 01:53:41,498
at least once every
three days to prevent it.

1795
01:53:41,935 --> 01:53:46,191
And so, exactly three
days after his execution

1796
01:53:46,507 --> 01:53:49,079
the light core shut itself down

1797
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:52,527
and with it - the production
of the shadow remedy.

1798
01:53:54,391 --> 01:53:56,213
He outsmarted you!

1799
01:53:56,365 --> 01:53:58,632
There is nothing funny about this!

1800
01:53:59,263 --> 01:54:01,529
Don't you realize what this means?

1801
01:54:01,743 --> 01:54:03,423
The Keepers are dying!

1802
01:54:03,846 --> 01:54:05,526
Thousands of good people.

1803
01:54:05,965 --> 01:54:10,626
No one will be spared
a slow and painful death.

1804
01:54:11,301 --> 01:54:12,816
Including you.

1805
01:54:13,705 --> 01:54:16,374
Unless you decide to help us.

1806
01:54:16,784 --> 01:54:21,136
Everything points to you being
the key to unlock this machine again.

1807
01:54:23,242 --> 01:54:25,146
You! *laughs*

1808
01:54:25,929 --> 01:54:28,565
You murdered my father and my mother!

1809
01:54:28,965 --> 01:54:31,431
You killed my friends in their sleep!

1810
01:54:31,807 --> 01:54:34,419
You took away everything that I ever loved!

1811
01:54:34,755 --> 01:54:40,132
And after all that, you
seriously expect me to help you?

1812
01:54:40,585 --> 01:54:43,556
Are you fucking kidding me?

1813
01:54:43,822 --> 01:54:46,766
The shadow remedy
will not only save our lives

1814
01:54:47,349 --> 01:54:49,834
it will also save yours!

1815
01:54:51,887 --> 01:54:55,151
I have been prepared to die
from the moment your people

1816
01:54:55,164 --> 01:54:58,236
burst into my mother's
home and slit her throat.

1817
01:54:58,814 --> 01:55:02,926
I am grateful for every
day I got to live after that

1818
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:06,738
but I was always aware
that my days were numbered.

1819
01:55:06,983 --> 01:55:08,783
I have nothing left to lose

1820
01:55:08,890 --> 01:55:12,346
and if I can take a filthy
pigrat like you to my grave

1821
01:55:12,616 --> 01:55:14,136
so much the better!

1822
01:55:14,993 --> 01:55:17,639
Well, what a shame.

1823
01:55:18,195 --> 01:55:20,528
If I can't talk sense into you

1824
01:55:20,957 --> 01:55:25,018
I guess we have to do
this the old-fashioned way.

1825
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,327
Send him in!

1826
01:55:28,468 --> 01:55:30,148
[electric door opens]

1827
01:55:31,019 --> 01:55:34,760

1829

RIVER!

1830
01:55:38,191 --> 01:55:39,642
Here he is, Overseer!

1831
01:55:40,025 --> 01:55:41,167
Thank you.

1832
01:55:42,006 --> 01:55:45,942
I knew you two would be
delighted to see each other again!

1833
01:55:45,955 --> 01:55:47,091
Mmmmmgmmhmmhmhm!

1834
01:55:47,318 --> 01:55:48,318
Ah...

1835
01:55:54,427 --> 01:55:55,427
Frostwind!

1836
01:55:55,739 --> 01:55:56,739
River!

1837
01:55:56,821 --> 01:55:58,480
I thought you were dead!

1838
01:56:00,974 --> 01:56:02,722
[minacious laughter]

1839
01:56:03,113 --> 01:56:05,482
So romantic!

1840
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:09,174
Two lovers, re-united.

1841
01:56:09,352 --> 01:56:12,456
Too bad that the wedding
has to be canceled!

1842
01:56:13,576 --> 01:56:14,576
Hey!

1843
01:56:14,654 --> 01:56:16,788
What do you want with my amulet?

1844
01:56:20,264 --> 01:56:22,597
This should take some
time to get it from me

1845
01:56:22,984 --> 01:56:26,080
but your father went a long
way to make this machine useless

1846
01:56:26,167 --> 01:56:28,866
in case this petty rebellion fails.

1847
01:56:29,410 --> 01:56:34,130
But then our spy saw you present
your amulet to the rebel scouts

1848
01:56:34,155 --> 01:56:36,396
and say the secret phrase…

1849
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:39,027
that showed us the way!

your moment has come to
heroically save the keeper race

1863

by telling us the REST of this song!

that nobody seems to know…

Dear brother

1870
01:57:39,534 --> 01:57:43,295
would you mind guarding the
door from the other side for a while?

1871
01:57:43,652 --> 01:57:45,045
It might get a little bit...

1872
01:57:47,336 --> 01:57:48,636
nasty in here.

Now just in case you want to
complain about my brutality again

1876
01:58:00,728 --> 01:58:03,528
Please notice that I
gave you not only one

1877
01:58:03,905 --> 01:58:06,805
but two chances to get
out of this unharmed.

1878
01:58:07,801 --> 01:58:09,458
You wanted it this way

1879
01:58:10,084 --> 01:58:11,084
not me.

Ahhh. Now, sing, my darling!

Sing!

01:58:28,772 --> 01:58:29,772
No!

1886
01:58:30,156 --> 01:58:30,908
No!

1887
01:58:30,932 --> 01:58:31,932
Don't do it!

2066
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,008
They had short lifespans,
but they bred rapidly

2067
02:07:53,179 --> 02:07:57,359
and consistent selection would make them
increasingly resistant to the radiation.

2068
02:07:57,647 --> 02:08:00,495
The nanotechnologists were
just as disgusted by this idea

2069
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:02,813
as the genetic engineers were by theirs.

2070
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:05,273
After many weeks of fruitless debate

2071
02:08:05,372 --> 02:08:07,972
the two teams eventually
struck out on their own

2072
02:08:07,997 --> 02:08:12,255
each of them hoping to be the first to
make the other group's efforts obsolete.

2073
02:08:12,713 --> 02:08:17,165
The genetic engieers made great
strides, and the results looked promising.

2074
02:08:17,556 --> 02:08:22,114
Each generation of animals turned out a little
bit more resistant against the radiation

2075
02:08:22,255 --> 02:08:25,624
and soon they were able to
permanently live outside the compound

2076
02:08:25,716 --> 02:08:30,114
performing the basic building and farming
tasks their masters had taught them.

2077
02:08:30,575 --> 02:08:33,968
Strict selection ensured that
only the most resistant individuals

2078
02:08:33,993 --> 02:08:35,433
were allowed to breed.

2079
02:08:35,567 --> 02:08:38,276
Those who turned out
ot be unfit to live outside

2080
02:08:38,453 --> 02:08:41,535
were trained to serve the
humans inside the compound.

2081
02:08:41,858 --> 02:08:44,488
But the geneticists' hopes
were rudely shattered one day

2082
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:48,145
when the nanotechnologists
announced that they had won the race.

2083
02:08:48,463 --> 02:08:53,191
They could now manufacture the radiation
cure we know today as the shadow remedy.

2084
02:08:53,566 --> 02:08:56,969
The leaders decided that there was
no need for further animal testing

2085
02:08:56,994 --> 02:08:59,735
and all remaining specimens
were to be destroyed.

2086
02:09:00,216 --> 02:09:02,375
A simple administrative act - but

2087
02:09:03,163 --> 02:09:06,299
the last one ever to be
decided by a human being.

2088
02:09:07,482 --> 02:09:09,560
The animal slaves living inside the bunker

2089
02:09:09,585 --> 02:09:12,368
had wisely hidden how
intelligent they really were

2090
02:09:12,699 --> 02:09:15,522
and they did not take
kindly to their masters' plans.

2091
02:09:16,182 --> 02:09:20,253
Their revolt was bloody,
marking the dawning of a new age.

2092
02:09:20,626 --> 02:09:24,287
An age in which
humans no longer existed.

2093
02:09:25,047 --> 02:09:29,402
The former slaves took over the place we
now call the Stronghold on the Holy Mountain

2094
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:33,578
appearing like gods to the commoners
still living outside the compound.

2095
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:35,769
Reveling in their newfound power

2096
02:09:35,787 --> 02:09:38,859
eventually they became
the Keepers of the Light.

2097
02:09:39,364 --> 02:09:40,297
To this day

2098
02:09:40,322 --> 02:09:43,550
the Holy Mountain holds the
knowledge of an entire civilisation

2099
02:09:43,738 --> 02:09:45,648
but rather than share the knowledge

2100
02:09:45,691 --> 02:09:49,324
the Keepers horde it for themselves
and keep the population dumb

2101
02:09:49,508 --> 02:09:52,314
poor, and dependent upon "godly gifts".

2102
02:09:52,423 --> 02:09:55,365
Gifts that are really just
products of human technology that

2103
02:09:55,411 --> 02:09:58,001
they don't even fully
understand themselves.

2104
02:09:58,319 --> 02:10:00,436
Now that the rebellion has failed

2105
02:10:00,488 --> 02:10:03,088
you are the only one I can trust.

2106
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,958
And I'm glad you were
able to follow my tracks.

2107
02:10:06,135 --> 02:10:08,630
Genocide is now no longer the last resort.

2108
02:10:08,987 --> 02:10:12,171
The Keepers' fate now rests in your hands.

2109
02:10:14,177 --> 02:10:16,244
Maybe you can do better than I.

2110
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:18,897
Maybe you haven't gone insane yet.

2111
02:10:19,006 --> 02:10:21,273
I trust you to do the right thing.

2112
02:10:21,479 --> 02:10:24,213
I trust you to bring the world the truth.

2113
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:27,090
Farewell, my beloved daughter.

2114
02:10:27,999 --> 02:10:28,999
Farewell.

2115
02:10:41,162 --> 02:10:42,162
Wow.

2116
02:10:43,245 --> 02:10:46,054
So this is what grandpa
Fireheart looked like!

2117
02:10:47,211 --> 02:10:51,894
Yes, Raindancer. I remember
it like it was yesterday.

2118
02:10:52,333 --> 02:10:54,870
I still miss him. And Riversong, too.

2119
02:10:56,067 --> 02:10:58,578
What happened after
you started the light core?

2120
02:10:58,794 --> 02:11:00,394
How did you get out?

2121
02:11:00,737 --> 02:11:03,371
Uncle Brushie used the main
computer to free the rebels

2122
02:11:03,378 --> 02:11:06,127
of team alpha that were still
being held in the courtyard

2123
02:11:06,224 --> 02:11:09,585
giving them instructions over
the intercom where to find us.

2124
02:11:09,987 --> 02:11:12,372
The Keepers were not
prepared for a sudden attack

2125
02:11:12,635 --> 02:11:15,579
and when they found
out that Ironwill was dead

2126
02:11:15,638 --> 02:11:18,724
and they no longer had
control over their own machinery

2127
02:11:18,779 --> 02:11:20,702
they eventually surrendered.

2128
02:11:20,799 --> 02:11:23,644
Wow! Huh, you're a hero!

2129
02:11:23,866 --> 02:11:26,084
Why didn't you tell me this before?

2130
02:11:26,167 --> 02:11:29,095
Because we wanted to be
sure you were ready for it.

2131
02:11:29,445 --> 02:11:31,765
It's quite a gruesome story after all.

2132
02:11:32,978 --> 02:11:33,825
Brushie…

2133
02:11:33,905 --> 02:11:37,111
I think he's old enough to
understand the real reason.

2134
02:11:37,454 --> 02:11:39,454
What is the real reason, then?

2135
02:11:39,855 --> 02:11:43,647
Because I am not a hero.

2136
02:11:44,581 --> 02:11:45,781
I'm a survivor.

2137
02:11:46,081 --> 02:11:47,881
And I feel guilty for that.

2138
02:11:48,139 --> 02:11:50,209
For Riversong, your father.

2139
02:11:50,606 --> 02:11:53,742
The reason I never told
you the whole story was…

2140
02:11:54,248 --> 02:11:55,248
I couldn't.

2141
02:11:55,694 --> 02:11:57,858
The scars needed to heal.

2142
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:00,540
But it wasn't your fault he died!

2143
02:12:00,791 --> 02:12:03,946
*sigh* It's not that easy
to come to terms with.

2144
02:12:05,056 --> 02:12:06,416
Well, if it helps

2145
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:10,886
For me, you're the most
awesome mom in the world!

2146
02:12:12,095 --> 02:12:14,429
Oh yes, it does!

2147
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:18,895
And one day, I want to be a scientist

2148
02:12:18,918 --> 02:12:21,358
just like grandpa Fireheart!

2149
02:12:21,665 --> 02:12:25,646
By the way, uncle Brushie, um,
can I ask you a question?

2150
02:12:25,681 --> 02:12:26,681
Sure!

2151
02:12:27,751 --> 02:12:30,254
Um, my - my biology teacher said

2152
02:12:30,712 --> 02:12:34,334
that a species is defined as
the largest group of organisms

2153
02:12:34,346 --> 02:12:38,096
capable of interbreeding
and producing fertile offspring.

2154
02:12:38,187 --> 02:12:41,579
Oh, that's right, Raindancer!
You did your homework well!

2155
02:12:41,637 --> 02:12:45,744
But - but daddy was a cat.
Mommy is a fox, so...

2156
02:12:46,907 --> 02:12:48,587
How did that even work?

2157
02:12:48,721 --> 02:12:50,731
[laughter]

2158
02:12:51,447 --> 02:12:55,404
Yes, uncle Brushie,
how did it even work?

2159
02:12:56,472 --> 02:12:59,499
Well, you see, that's...

2160
02:13:00,670 --> 02:13:04,008
that's because we're not
all really different species.

2161
02:13:07,646 --> 02:13:10,847
Under the fur, we're all just humans.

2162
02:13:11,432 --> 02:13:13,565
We just look a little different.

2163
02:13:16,039 --> 02:13:17,039
Me too?

2164
02:13:18,536 --> 02:13:20,379
Yes, you too.

2165
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:22,835
But enough heavy subjects.

2166
02:13:23,247 --> 02:13:24,927
Tonight's festival night!

2167
02:13:25,061 --> 02:13:27,145
-Don't you want to see your present?
-Oh yes!

2168
02:13:27,232 --> 02:13:29,475
Yes, yes of course! What is it?

2169
02:13:33,481 --> 02:13:34,481
Wow...

2170
02:13:35,174 --> 02:13:36,174
Wow!

2171
02:13:37,330 --> 02:13:38,330
This...

2172
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:40,200
This is the...

2173
02:13:40,502 --> 02:13:42,502
The Tree of Knowledge Pendant?

2174
02:13:44,847 --> 02:13:46,527
Is that the real one?

2175
02:13:46,958 --> 02:13:47,738
Yes.

2176
02:13:47,767 --> 02:13:49,882
May it always protect you.

2177
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:51,947
And may it always remind you

2178
02:13:52,023 --> 02:13:56,439
that your family and your friends
will be there for you at all times!

2179
02:13:57,766 --> 02:13:59,453
Oh thank you, mom!

2180
02:14:08,318 --> 02:14:10,550
-Hey, Brushie, old-boy!
-What

2181
02:14:10,618 --> 02:14:13,191
the hell! Sparky! Longleaf!

2182
02:14:13,243 --> 02:14:15,580
I haven't seen you in ages!

2183
02:14:15,671 --> 02:14:18,988
Did you come all the way
from Ironforge just to see us?

2184
02:14:19,349 --> 02:14:22,677
Well, drinking alone is
only half the fun, isn't it?

2185
02:14:23,011 --> 02:14:24,099
We're gonna get hammered!

2186
02:14:24,117 --> 02:14:25,537
Just like in the old times!

2187
02:14:25,857 --> 02:14:29,418
What a wonderful surprise!
Come on in, everybody!

2188
02:14:36,802 --> 02:14:38,281
My... My Lord!

2189
02:14:38,918 --> 02:14:44,357
I... I hereby most subserviently request
permission to get hammered, too.

2190
02:14:45,812 --> 02:14:46,812
Seriously?

2191
02:14:47,035 --> 02:14:50,164
Are you still holding a grudge
against me after all those years?

2192
02:14:50,329 --> 02:14:52,729
Oh well, go, meet with your friends!

2193
02:14:52,811 --> 02:14:55,026
Yipppiehh!

2194
02:15:00,544 --> 02:15:02,224
Citizens of Ferndale!

2195
02:15:02,642 --> 02:15:06,226
May I have your attention
while everybody is still sober.

2196
02:15:06,576 --> 02:15:10,086
We are celebrating a
special anniversary today.

2197
02:15:10,614 --> 02:15:15,734
It has been exactly 10 years since the
liberation from the Keepers of the Light.

2198
02:15:16,084 --> 02:15:18,551
And we've come a long way since then.

2199
02:15:18,616 --> 02:15:22,459
We are no longer blind to
the true origin of our species

2200
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,637
The ancient scientific
knowledge is now free for all

2201
02:15:27,184 --> 02:15:32,305
and although we're not quite ready yet
to master it like our human forefathers did

2202
02:15:32,663 --> 02:15:36,690
it has already improved
our lives in numerous ways.

2203
02:15:37,202 --> 02:15:41,251
The strangling collar of the
Keepers' reign has been taken from us.

2204
02:15:41,602 --> 02:15:46,149
And so I wish to dedicate
this years' Festival of Light

2205
02:15:46,580 --> 02:15:52,252
to our heroes who lost their lives in
the most unlikely battle of our history

2206
02:15:53,603 --> 02:15:55,826
Fireheart of Coldlake

2207
02:15:56,403 --> 02:15:58,083
Riversong of Ferndale

2208
02:15:58,782 --> 02:16:00,782
and the rebels of Camp Freedom.

2209
02:16:01,486 --> 02:16:04,795
They will always live on in our hearts!
