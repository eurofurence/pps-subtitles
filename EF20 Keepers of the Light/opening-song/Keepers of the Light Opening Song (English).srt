59
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:06,105
It was the year 385
after the Awakening.

60
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:11,541
The village of Ferndale lay cozily nestled
in the valley of the Serpent River

61
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:14,656
where the winds sweeping
down from the Holy Mountain

62
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,987
tingled with the scent of pine trees

63
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,416
and the streets were filled
with the sounds of playing children

64
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,444
and oxen carts on cobblestone.

65
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,812
As with every other village,
each household

66
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:27,692
needed to have its own holy light.

67
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:33,287
These were nothing like ordinary lanterns.
They were gifts from the gods.

68
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:38,858
They shone bright as fire, yet without
flame, and nothing could extinguish them.

69
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:44,139
But the most important thing was that,
while even the strongest walls and gates

70
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:47,661
could not keep the dark creatures away
that came from the forest in the night

71
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:49,959
the holy light could.

72
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,998
A home without a light would not
have been a safe place to live

73
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:58,458
and leaving the village without one
at night would have been plain suicide.

74
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:03,821
Over the course of months, however, even
a holy light would eventually begin to dim.

75
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,192
And so, once every year
at the time of the summer solstice

76
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:13,487
farmers, millers, blacksmiths, bakers,
carpenters, spinsters, weavers, cobblers

77
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,933
everyone in the village
who could afford to do so

78
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:21,352
would lay down their work for a day
and celebrate The Festival of Lights.

79
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,129
Families would gather in their homes

80
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:27,410
and selebrate each other’s
company with lots of mulled

81
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:30,517
wine, mince pie, and
other festive specialties.

82
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,946
Parents would give their children
homemade presents

83
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:37,624
and in the evening the village priests
would walk from door to door

84
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:41,385
giving everyone their blessing,
and renew the lights in every house.

85
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:45,008
For the villagers, this was
the happiest day of the year

86
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,765
 as the return of light to their home
reminded them

87
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,091
that the gods and their earthly servants
would always be there

88
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:52,509
to love and protect them.

89
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,680
For they were the Keepers of the Light.

90
