1
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:18,241
Trust 
is a thing that is earned through my fire,

2
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,379
It's so easily burned.

3
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:23,424
Dreams 
are my craves to the deep

4
00:00:23,484 --> 00:00:26,665
Beneath a world we're struggling to keep.

5
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:29,082
Help me free myself,

6
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:32,633
myself from my chain,

7
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:38,993
So that we can fight this machine again!

8
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:42,776
The tides - they are changing,
Trust is forsaking,

9
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:45,575
fulfil me!

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,448
My fear is surrounding, 
Tearing and drowning,

11
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:52,394
nowhere to hide...

12
00:00:52,814 --> 00:01:00,792
Here comes the end tide...

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,313
Change 
in the void of the storm through my fire

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,574
my desires will swarm,

15
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,885
Bold 
my wings open on land

16
00:01:15,145 --> 00:01:18,203
To face our trial that's at hand

17
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,230
Help me see myself,

18
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:23,503
myself through this veil

19
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:30,739
So that we can fight this machine again!

20
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:35,575
The tides - they are changing,
Trust is forsaking,

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,114
fulfil me!

22
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:42,215
My fear is surrounding,
Tearing and drowning,

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,055
nowhere to hide...

24
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,582
Face it and ride,

25
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:54,135
Here comes the end tide.

26
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:07,496
Water may heal but reveals all is dark

27
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,480
Deep in the void we make our own mark

28
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:15,771
To fear what we know
to the world we must show:

29
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:17,081
The end tide!

30
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:20,413
The tides - they are changing,
Trust is forsaking,

31
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,229
fulfil me!

32
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:27,016
My fear is surrounding,
Tearing and drowning,

33
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,014
nowhere to hide...

34
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:39,148
We stand side by side 
Until the end tide!

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,776
The tides - they are changing,
Trust is forsaking,

36
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:45,594
fulfill me!

37
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:49,429
My fear is surrounding,
Tearing and drowning,

38
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:52,601
nowhere to hide...

39
00:02:52,789 --> 00:03:00,340
Here comes the end tide!

40
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:06,829
Here comes the end tide!

41
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:11,583
Here comes the end tide!

42
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:19,752
Here comes, here comes, 
here comes the end tide!

43
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:26,819
Here comes the end tide!
