1
00:00:08,872 --> 00:00:11,716
Come on, baby, I know you can do it!

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,557
Huh. Maybe that screw was in the way?

3
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,387
Good riddance.

4
00:00:20,582 --> 00:00:23,184
Now, let's try that again.

5
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,523
Hah-hah-hah, I knew it!

6
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,910
Screw you, you stupid screw!

7
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:30,996
Yes!

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,721
No, I mean, nonononono!

9
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:38,648
*cough* *cough* *cough* *cough*

10
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,971
Cake delivery for Mr French! *cough*

11
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,476
What's with the smoke?

12
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,701
Did you try to bake one yourself?

13
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:56,088
*cough* No no, it's just this piece
of junk that almost blew up on me.

14
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:59,034
Come on in, come on in.
Is that the cake I ordered?

15
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:02,101
Yes, if your name is Abraham French

16
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:05,033
this is your double
layer vanilla cream cake.

17
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:06,960
With a cherry on top?

18
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:08,995
Just like you ordered, sir!

19
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:11,246
Would you be so kind
as to sign the receipt?

20
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:16,021
Oh, absolutely! Let me find a
clean cloth to wipe my paws with.

21
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:21,232
A pawprint will do, I think, mister French.

22
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:22,494
All right!

23
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:29,739
Yeah, I think that'll do.

24
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:34,155
Thank you very much for
shopping with Harrington's

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,080
purveyors to Her Highness
the Queen of Astar.

26
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,073
I appreciate the speedy delivery, Miss.

27
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:44,933
The Hazelwoods will be coming over for
tea and the cake is a surprise for them!

28
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:48,502
I'm sure they will love it!

29
00:01:48,548 --> 00:01:53,052
Good day Mr. French, and
best regards to the Hazelwoods!

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,821
Bye, miss Herrington!

31
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,822
Ok, where was I?

32
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:00,533
[door closes]

33
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:04,931
[door opens]

34
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:12,191
Umh. So sorry Mr. French,
I couldn't help but notice…

35
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,412
what happened to the poor bike?

36
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:20,106
Oh… Um... something's
wrong with the engine.

37
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,978
Nothing a woman would understand.

38
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,699
The HW-22 is the first of the series
with the new four stroke engine

39
00:02:32,724 --> 00:02:35,989
and the lubrication
system can be a bit finnicky.

40
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:40,126
Now, if you have a 12mm wrench,
I can show you what I mean…

41
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:43,473
Uhm… Yeah, it's… over in the toolbox…

42
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:47,858
Um... are you sure you can… I mean… Uhm...

43
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:56,647
A-ha! The oil line check
valve is stuck on open.

44
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,417
That's typical. This engine
hasn't been run in a while, has it?

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,207
Why yes, the winter's been
too harsh to take her for a ride.

46
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:19,975
Purring like a kitten!

47
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:24,940
Growling like a tigress, more
like. How did you do that?

48
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:27,535
Something was wrong with the engine.

49
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:30,823
Nothing a man would understand.

50
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,071
Well played young Miss, well played.

51
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:42,893
Pardon my saying so, but aren't your
talents being wasted delivering cakes?

52
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:48,272
You're very kind, but my mother needs all
the help she can get in the pastry shop.

53
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:51,645
Wait a minute…

54
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:55,263
are you the daughter of Peter Harrington?

55
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:57,885
Of Harrington & Welsh?

56
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,502
Not any more. On both counts.

57
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,795
Miss Harrington - your father
literally invented the airplane!

58
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:10,897
And clearly the same grease
runs through your veins, too.

59
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:13,577
As a child, I wanted to be an engineer!

60
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:14,792
But...

61
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:16,861
after father's accident…

62
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,584
Mother never got over the loss.

63
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:23,189
She sold our part of the
company to Mr. Welsh, and

64
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:26,623
I had to promise to never
set foot in a workshop again.

65
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:30,584
Well, unless I'm delivering cakes!

66
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:31,833
[door opens]

67
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:34,264
Hey, French!

68
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:38,692
You gotta put this poster in
your window! It's from Mr. Welsh!

69
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,569
What in earth's name, Cal!

70
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:43,300
Can't you see I'm having
a conversation with a lady?

71
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:46,513
Put the bloody thing on
the counter, and bugger off!

72
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,597
Mr. Welsh says you
gotta to put it up right now!

73
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:52,175
The trans-oceanic expedition has returned

74
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:54,949
and you won't believe what they've found!

75
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:59,471
There's going to be a big show with brass
band, moving pictures, the whole shebang!

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,106
For a few bucks we'll give
you a tour of the airship

77
00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:04,612
and of course we have
our special attraction:

78
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,651
The Beast from another world!

79
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,267
Oh! Can I have a poster too?

80
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:12,720
My father designed that airship!

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,067
Girl, we're not running a charity!

82
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,191
Printing these costs money!

83
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,548
I'll put it in the window of
our pastry shop! I promise!

84
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:22,850
Pastry Shop?

85
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,343
Does that mean you brought me cake?

86
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:26,933
No!

87
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,775
And what's that?

88
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:30,903
That one's for Mr. French!

89
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:33,249
Keep your dirty paws off!

90
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:36,198
Hmmm…. nomnomnom.

91
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:40,796
Hey! What do you think you're doing!

92
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:43,588
Hmmm…. so delicious and moist.

93
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:46,057
Mr. French paid for that cake!

94
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:48,326
You can't just come in and eat it!

95
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:50,175
And watcha gonna do about it, huh?

96
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,540
See you at the
exhibition on Saturday!

97
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,129
Bye-bye!

98
00:05:58,534 --> 00:05:59,890
Uhhh!

99
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,780
How rude was that?!

100
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:06,813
Well, if that's Mr. Welsh's
new charm offensive

101
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,727
I see a lot of room for improvement!

102
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,141
I'm not going to let that
sucker ruin your day.

103
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,808
I'll get you a new cake, and
if I have to, make it myself.

104
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:19,241
Will 4 o'clock still be fine?

105
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,157
No no no, don't worry, it wasn't your fault

106
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,190
and there's still more left
than we can eat anyway.

107
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,393
Well... Are you sure?

108
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,924
And if you'd like to get
your paws dirty again

109
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:37,053
you're more than welcome
to come back after work anytime.

110
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:40,169
Or how about Saturday night?

111
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:41,749
I beg your pardon!?

112
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:44,879
Damn, that came out all wrong, didn't it?

113
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,584
I mean the exhibition.

114
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:49,240
I think we'd have a great time together.

115
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:53,273
Us. Two engineers at
heart. You know what I mean.

116
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:58,297
I... Uh... I don't think
Mother would allow that.

117
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:02,211
You're a grown up woman,
can't you go wherever you want?

118
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:08,739
*sigh* I wonder what you're really
interested in: The airship or me?

119
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,036
Um, maybe a little bit of both?

120
00:07:11,094 --> 00:07:15,454
*chuckles* I see. But what about your wife?

121
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:20,497
Oh, Clarice? Pistons and crankshafts
would have bored her to death.

122
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:21,986
Would have?

123
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:24,641
Yeah, she's no longer with me.

124
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:27,331
Hasn't been for a long time.

125
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,178
Oh … I'm so sorry to hear that!

126
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:32,710
Life must go on, doesn't it?

127
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,047
Absolutely. You know what?

128
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:39,619
I think I'll bite. Saturday at 9 then?

129
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,918
Yes! Excellent!

130
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:47,387
Looking forward to lots of pistons
and crankshafts, Mr. French!

131
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,458
Me too! See you on Saturday!

132
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,762
Bye!

Oh wow, would you just look at her!

She is so much bigger than I thought.

Really?

I'd say she's exactly as
big as I hoped she would be.

00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:33,922
That is so typical for Welsh.

178
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,603
He'll never pass up a chance
to show off just how rich he is.

179
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,516
Ooh, do I hear a touch of envy?

180
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:45,265
The company "Harrington & Welsh"
was founded at my mom's kitchen table

181
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:50,370
by my father, the engineer,
and Welsh, the salesman.

182
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:55,995
He could sell you a cup of horse piss and
make you believe it's a '65 Chateau de Ferèt.

183
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:58,286
Florence! Such a potty mouth!

184
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,936
I have absolutely no
sympathy for this…

185
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,604
person.

186
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,239
But why?

187
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,903
Because my name is
Harrington, and I deliver cake?

188
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,802
Oh. Yeah. Point taken, sorry.

189
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:17,755
If you want my advice -
don't believe a word he says.

190
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:21,578
This is not an exhibition,
it's a sales pitch.

191
00:13:22,075 --> 00:13:24,691
Yeah, but... the airship!

192
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:28,428
It is still marvelous!

193
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:33,431
Oh my god, yes she is

194
00:13:34,076 --> 00:13:37,218
And guess who didn't design her!

195
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:39,395
[Loudspeaker] Ladies and Gentleman

196
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,854
welcome to "The Trans Oceanic
Expedition Magical Moving Picture Show"

197
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:47,128
Please take a seat, the
show is about to begin!

198
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:52,184
This is Feivel Mc Brookhaven
for Astar National Radio

199
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,232
reporting live from Port Ospen

200
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:56,782
proud capital of the
kingdom of great Astar.

201
00:13:56,814 --> 00:14:00,568
The royal geographic society has
confirmed that Mr. Welsh's expedition

202
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,872
has indeed found a
mysterious uninhabited continent

203
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:05,852
far in the South Astarian Sea.

204
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,951
The Peter M. Harrington
Airfield is bursting with people

205
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:12,405
curious to see the incredible
spectacle that is about to begin

206
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:15,583
celebrating the return of
Mr. Welsh and his crew.

207
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:28,205
Harrington & Welsh,
conqueror of the skies of Astar

208
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:32,234
and suppressor of the uprising
of Vanos proudly presents

209
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:35,512
The Trans-Oceanic Expedition!

210
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,386
We have long shared the dream of
expanding our realm beyond the horizon!

211
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:47,882
But so far explorers have found nothing but a few
barren islands within the ice of the northern sea.

212
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:52,079
Thanks to the HW-129 long range airship

213
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:55,758
we were able to venture farther
than any explorer before us.

214
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,320
It provides twice the space for provisions

215
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:01,092
requires less than half
the crew of a traditional ship

216
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,752
and even carries two HW-21 war planes
in case defense becomes necessary.

217
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:10,599
The unnamed continent
is a rich tropical paradise

218
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:13,953
full of exotic plants and
animals never seen before

219
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:18,471
and millions of acres of fertile
ground rich in valuable minerals

220
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,594
waiting to be mined and traded.

221
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:23,770
But exploring a new
world is a dangerous affair.

222
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,818
You never know what awaits you.

223
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,113
Dangerous weather!

224
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,451
Poisonous plants!

225
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,120
Or even fierce, savage beasts!

226
00:15:33,219 --> 00:15:36,147
We were peacefully flying along the shore

227
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,680
mapping out the coastline

228
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:41,152
when we were suddenly attacked
by these huge flying animals.

229
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,036
They looked like feathered dragons

230
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,908
trying to sink their claws into our hull!

231
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:48,322
We were in fear for our lives!

232
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:51,598
They were the most horrible
things we had ever seen

233
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:54,430
and they seemed to
have only one thing in mind

234
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:57,650
KILL! KILL KILL!

235
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:11,981
The audience reels in terror

236
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:15,198
as one of the beasts is
revealed in the flesh

237
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:19,783
showing its sleek red body and the
sharp fangs of a bloodthirsty predator!

238
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,924
What a horrific sight indeed!

239
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,306
I'm barely standing 20 feet away

240
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:25,898
and my legs are shaking.

241
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:26,938
SHAKING!

242
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:30,684
Fear not, people of Astar!

243
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,231
This beast can not hurt you.

244
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,585
It was subdued and brought to the kingdom

245
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:39,490
as a gift of gratitude to her
Majesty, Queen Irdis of great Astar!

246
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:44,343
Together we will conquer the world,
with Airships by Harrington and Welsh!

247
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:54,899
Oh - my - god! What a terrible show!

248
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:58,054
Really? I found it quite
entertaining, actually

249
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:01,687
It was dreadful! Horrendous! Abysmal!

250
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:07,237
No mention of any of the inventions that
made the ship possible in the first place!

251
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,602
The complex multi-plane fins

252
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:14,248
the two-row radial engines with
their centrifugal superchargers

253
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,292
using a gas as fuel…

254
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:19,762
Oh, I could go on like this forever!

255
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:22,452
You seem to know a lot about the airship!

256
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,692
Of course I do!

257
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,420
My father designed it!

258
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:29,050
The only thing Welsh ever
contributed to it was his name.

259
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,196
And who in their right mind puts
warplanes on a research vessel?

260
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:36,753
Maybe it's good for more than one purpose.

261
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:38,119
Damn right.

262
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,000
I told you it's a sales pitch.

263
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:44,515
The war against Vanos made
him the richest man in the world

264
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,913
but that's over now.

265
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:51,323
It's no coincidence he's showing us
the most scary beast he could find.

266
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:55,127
He needs a new threat to keep
his war machines in demand.

267
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:57,203
Father would have never allowed this.

268
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:59,741
He wanted to make the world a better place.

269
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,858
But would he have won the war?

270
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:05,219
In war there are no winners.

271
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,268
Hey, you! Stay away from the cage!

272
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,037
Or you'll lose an arm! Yes, I mean you!

273
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,382
HEY! How would you feel
locked up in a cage like that

274
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,485
thousands of miles away from home?

275
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,297
Oh shut up, woman!

276
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:24,343
Stop pestering the poor animal!

277
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,887
Can't you see it's scared?

278
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:28,332
I'm just showing her
who's the man in the house!

279
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,525
Is that also how you
treat your wife at home?

280
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:35,847
Haha, hello, if that isn't
our esteemed Mr. French!

281
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:39,138
How much cake did you
have to order for the date, huh?

282
00:18:39,163 --> 00:18:41,709
One more word, and I'm
going to get up there and...

283
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,023
[BOOM!]

284
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,222
We interrupt our program
for these breaking news.

285
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:54,368
A bomb has exploded at the Peter M.
Harrington airfield just a few seconds ago.

286
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:57,342
People are running for cover,
trying to find shelter!

287
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:59,171
The airship does not seem to be damaged

288
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:01,803
but it's unclear how many
are wounded or even dead.

289
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:03,324
Is this a terrorist attack?

290
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:05,720
Is this the revenge of
separatists from Vanos?

291
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:06,390
We will…

292
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:07,854
[BOOM!]

293
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,990
We are under attack.
Prepare for immediate takeoff.

294
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:14,092
All crew on board.

295
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:18,029
I repeat, we are under attack.
Prepare for immediate takeoff.

296
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:22,000
Shine some torches over
here, I need some goddamn light!

297
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,249
Ahh...

298
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:28,004
Damn it!

299
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:29,555
Damn it!

300
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:33,569
It's stuck!

301
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:38,693
Come here! Come here
you sissies and help me!

302
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,137
[BOOM!]

303
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,602
No! The poor animal!

304
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:54,105
It might get hurt!

305
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:01,422
Calm down! Everything will be alright!

306
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:06,303
Hey, hey, keep away
from the cage!

307
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:09,220
You idiot! She will rip your arm right off!

308
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:11,278
Oh let me help you pull the rope!

309
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:14,328
The one that just broke?!

310
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:17,215
Uh, if you want to help,
then stay out of the way!

311
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:26,427
ACK! Dammit! Stop biting me!

312
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:30,151
Why won't you do what I
tell you! It's for your own good!

313
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:33,487
Goddamn bitch!

314
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:37,225
What the hell are you doing?
You're just frightening her even more!

315
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,659
What the hell are you
doing? Are you crazy?!

316
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,057
Hey there. Everything will be okay!

317
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:47,965
Just calm down! I'm not
going to hurt you. Just trust me.

318
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,100
Wait, what?

319
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:02,396
You're not deaf, like the other ones?

320
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,688
How is that possible?

321
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:06,968
And you have a name?

322
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,290
Florence?

323
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:12,412
Please help me, Florence! Help me!

324
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:23,678
I told you she's gonna bite
you, to stay away from the cage!

325
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:25,440
Stupid wouldn't listen!

326
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,564
She's not an animal!

327
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,790
What? What are you talking about?

328
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:33,611
She has said She! Is! Not! An! Animal!

329
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:35,136
What?

330
00:21:36,636 --> 00:21:41,318
How… how the hell did
you calm her down like that?

331
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,464
You wouldn't understand!

332
00:21:43,732 --> 00:21:47,010
Let's get her to the airship!
Or do you want her to burn alive?

333
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:49,082
Er, no, no. Of course not.

334
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:57,743
Batten down the hatches, close
the cargo doors, all hands aboard!

335
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,290
No!

336
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,136
Don't close the doors! Wait for us!

337
00:22:07,168 --> 00:22:10,602
Florence, come back! What am
I supposed to tell your mother?

338
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:14,549
Just make something up! You're a smart man!

339
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:15,808
Are you kidding me?

340
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,987
Florence? Florence! Goddammit!

341
00:22:34,008 --> 00:22:42,350
[applause]

342
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:44,770
[knocking]

343
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:47,073
[knocking]

344
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:48,968
[door opens]

345
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:51,162
I don't buy anything at the door.

346
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:54,975
So take your samples and your
magazines and have a good day, Sir!

347
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,445
Stop... Ms. Harrington, please!

348
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,949
Please, Ms. Harrington! My...
My name is Abraham French

349
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:04,224
I need to talk to you! It is urgent!

350
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,370
[door opens]

351
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:06,914
Have we met before?

352
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:11,802
Very briefly. I ordered a cake
from your shop a few days ago.

353
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,488
French, you say?

354
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:15,188
-French…
-Yes...

355
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:18,137
Double vanilla cream
cake with extra olives?

356
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:19,526
No, cherries.

357
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:21,976
Good grief, why would I think olives?

358
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:24,437
Actually, glazed olives might work

359
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:27,195
-on a savoury carrot cake, with the right...
-Ms. Harrington, please, Ms. Harrington!

360
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,770
That's not why I'm here.

361
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:32,060
-It's about your daughter.
-Oh.

362
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:33,489
Florence?

363
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,696
Can I please come in, Mrs. Harrington?
I'm afraid the matter is… delicate.

364
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:41,729
All right. This better be important!

365
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:44,923
So what did she do this time?

366
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:49,373
Florence and I went to see
Mr. Welsh's exhibition. Together.

367
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:52,969
Partners in crime! How romantic.

368
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:56,646
But don't you think she's a
little bit too young for you?

369
00:23:56,742 --> 00:24:02,162
No! I mean yes… I mean… Mrs.
Harrington, that's not – I'd never…

370
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:07,763
You can stop sweating and fretting,
Mr. French, I'm only pulling your leg.

371
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,358
Consider it a mother's revenge

372
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:14,398
I told her not to go, and I'm
sure my daughter told you that.

373
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,517
But it's Peter's airship

374
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:20,302
so I doubt you had to work
hard to convince her to go see it.

375
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,850
I'm afraid it's worse
than that, Mrs. Harrington.

376
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,893
There was a terrorist attack.

377
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:30,912
Bombs – laid by vanosian
seperatists, so they say.

378
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:32,954
Oh my god, is Florence alright?

379
00:24:32,994 --> 00:24:35,263
Mrs. Harrington… I don't know!

380
00:24:35,327 --> 00:24:36,593
What do you mean?

381
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:40,126
She tried to rescue an animal
that was part of the show.

382
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:42,556
She jumped on board of the airship, and...

383
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:45,426
then it took off. With her.

384
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:48,236
*SIGH* That is my daughter.

385
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:51,480
Strong sense of justice,
her father would say

386
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:53,643
fool-headed, if you ask me.

387
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:57,235
You'll have to get used to that if
you intend to keep courting her.

388
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,940
Mrs. Harrington, please!

389
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,293
She didn't get hurt, that's what matters.

390
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,636
Thank you so much for coming
here and letting me know.

391
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:10,588
Clarice and I never had any children…

392
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:14,898
but if we had, I wished it
would have been a girl like Florence.

393
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:19,995
I convinced her to go, and I
was responsible for her safety

394
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:23,001
but I let her down – and I let you down.

395
00:25:23,044 --> 00:25:25,044
I'm so so sorry.

396
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:28,449
Mr. French, please stop gushing.

397
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:32,733
Your worry does you credit,
but she's no child any more

398
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:36,713
no matter how much old
people like us wish she still were.

399
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,647
She made her own decisions

400
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:41,940
both to go to see the
airship, and to board it.

401
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,386
I just hope she's fine.

402
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:46,802
Florence makes good decisions

403
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:49,814
even though they can be damn inconvenient.

404
00:25:50,085 --> 00:25:52,018
You and I may be worried sick

405
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:54,006
but I'm sure she's all right.

406
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:56,991
Say, do you have a telephone?

407
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:58,432
I'm afraid not.

408
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:02,600
Okay. But I do. And
Florence has my number. So–

409
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,121
Oh, so you gave her your number?

410
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:08,600
No! I assure you... *chuckles* Oh, I get it

411
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:12,393
You know, if she calls
me, I will let you know.

412
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:15,418
Otherwise I'll check
back with you tomorrow.

413
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:19,135
Let's do that. And thank
you again for your help.

414
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,727
We made it!

415
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:49,979
Yeah! Hard to believe, since I had
to drag YOU along by the petticoat.

416
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:51,947
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

417
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:55,554
Women, why do they
always have to get in the way.

418
00:26:57,003 --> 00:27:00,107
You now stay off the cage.

419
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,519
Did I look like I needed YOUR help?

420
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,269
SHE did, you stupid thug!

421
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:06,210
She begged me to save her!

422
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:07,691
Oh, sure. You're crazy!

423
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:10,529
Maybe, but I'm still right.

424
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:12,729
And YOU are still a thug.

425
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:18,137
And SHE is an intelligent being, like
the both of us, and she's scared to death!

426
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:20,324
How would you know?
Beasts can't talk!

427
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:22,823
So she must not be a beast, then.

428
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,527
And she didn't… talk.

429
00:27:25,726 --> 00:27:30,257
I mean with her mouth. She
just - told me. I don't know how.

430
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:32,503
Yeah. Enough of that rubbish!

431
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:35,591
You're not allowed to be here,
and I'll have to explain Mr. Welsh

432
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:39,568
what Florence Harrington
is doing in his cargo bay!

433
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,966
*sigh* This is bad. This is really bad!

434
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:44,839
Hey, where are you going?

435
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:49,560
I'm gonna try and convince Welsh
not to throw the both of us out the hatch.

436
00:27:49,612 --> 00:27:51,292
Why would he do that?

437
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:54,980
Do you want it in alphabetical,
or chronological order?

438
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:58,915
Stay where you are, and
keep your paws off the cage!

439
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,777
I know it was real.

440
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:15,281
And if the entire world
thinks I'm crazy, I just know it!

441
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:20,658
Yes, I'm talking about you.

442
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,262
Do you understand me?

443
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,601
You spoke to me before!

444
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:31,468
Why don't you do it now?

445
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:35,303
Come on! Say something! Please?

446
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:40,615
Now you're just making fun of me.

447
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:46,167
You could have bitten my arm off.

448
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:47,392
But you didn't.

449
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,844
You can't be as evil as they say.

450
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:53,684
Good girl… there's a good girl…

451
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:04,347
Hello again, Florence!

452
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:08,246
Argh! What … what are
you doing inside my head?

453
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,240
And how do you know my name?

454
00:29:11,456 --> 00:29:13,316
I'm not deaf, Florence.

455
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:17,981
You don't have to think so
loudly at me – or so much!

456
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:21,680
What – I think too much?
You sound like my mother.

457
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:27,560
What? Florence, I can barely
hear you over the noise of your fear!

458
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:33,102
Wait, that's not fear…
You're curious, aren't you?

459
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,837
Now you sound just like my father!

460
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:42,851
Your father – the accident – oh
please, don't feel so much at me.

461
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:49,216
Focus, Florence, focus
on me, on us, here and now.

462
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,876
Relax. Think less. Say more.

463
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,279
I'll try, Ortha. I'll try!

464
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:07,172
Ahhhh, yes! So much better!

465
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:12,623
Wait! Ortha? Is that your
name? How do I know your name?

466
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:15,397
The same way I know yours.

467
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:19,883
Yes, my name is Ortha,
guardian of the realm.

468
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,977
Realm? Which realm? Where are you from?

469
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,013
We just call it home.

470
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:30,739
Now, Florence, I would like to
know where I am right now.

471
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,926
This is the Kingdom of Great Astar.

472
00:30:35,562 --> 00:30:40,106
That name doesn't mean anything to
me. Could you picture it in your head?

473
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:44,106
Yes, but I never got to
see much of it from above.

474
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,362
But you wanted to, didn't you?

475
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:51,197
To fly, like your father.

476
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:58,287
It breaks my heart to see you're still so
full of sadness, after even so many years.

477
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,495
Was I still thinking about him?

478
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:06,079
Wait… you're thinking about
someone too. Someone you lost?

479
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:10,556
My brother, Sitho.

480
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:14,050
He was a guardian like me.

481
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:17,449
The deaf ones came
in their flying machines.

482
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,879
We flew out to guide them
to a safe landing place.

483
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:26,927
But they attacked us, and soon the
sea was red with the blood of my kin.

484
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:32,255
Those who survived hid in the
forest, high up in the mountains.

485
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,421
I was injured, and
they captured me.

486
00:31:35,712 --> 00:31:39,207
Deaf? You mean, you
couldn't read their minds?

487
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:44,167
To me, this is as normal
as talking is to you.

488
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:47,096
Oh, I'm so glad we found each other.

489
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:50,129
Everything makes so much more sense now.

490
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:55,895
So this Mr. Welsh is the
one who built the war ship

491
00:31:56,038 --> 00:32:00,082
and I'm the trophy he wants
to present to his Queen?

492
00:32:00,247 --> 00:32:03,903
Ortha! I definitely wasn't
thinking about any of that.

493
00:32:04,141 --> 00:32:05,581
You were snooping!

494
00:32:06,532 --> 00:32:08,212
Can you blame me?

495
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:09,849
I'm in a cage!

496
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,748
Now, you need to talk to Cal.

497
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:18,292
He is the only one who
can get me out of this thing.

498
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,131
Why would he do that?

499
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:22,878
He's like, Welsh's left hand!

500
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:28,003
I don't need to snoop to
find out what you think of him

501
00:32:28,034 --> 00:32:30,795
but there's more to him than you know.

502
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:32,857
He cared for my wounds

503
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:36,897
he spent a lot of time finding
out what kind of food I like

504
00:32:37,044 --> 00:32:41,313
and he made a lot of gentle mouth
noises when nobody was looking.

505
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:43,319
I think he likes me.

506
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,745
Not enough to let you free.

507
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,820
But enough to bring me fish.

508
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:53,922
Ew, could you please not
think about the smell so much?

509
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:57,149
And to me he's basically been…

510
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,237
An arsehole? *chuckles*

511
00:33:01,473 --> 00:33:03,461
That is such a funny image.

512
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,731
No, don't blush. It's really funny!

513
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:12,122
A lady is not supposed to say that!

514
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:15,307
But you think it all the time.

515
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:21,832
Oh! Do you hear that?

516
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:24,288
I think someone's coming!

517
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:26,756
Will you stay close to me?

518
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:30,311
It seems we need to
touch each other to hear each other

519
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:33,080
maybe I can hear them through your ears.

520
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:36,527
There she is.

521
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:37,903
Well...

522
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,654
She's gone completely out of her mind!

523
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:42,905
I tried to keep her from
entering the ship, but

524
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:46,168
getting the beast out of
danger was my first priority!

525
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:52,668
Ms. Harrington, welcome
aboard my humble ship.

526
00:33:53,544 --> 00:33:58,794
May I know the reason why you are
honoring us with this unexpected visit?

527
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:02,172
I helped Cal move the
cage into the cargo bay

528
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:05,349
and I didn't manage to
get off the ship in time.

529
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,649
As simple as that.

530
00:34:08,728 --> 00:34:10,662
I suppose I should thank you.

531
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:14,951
This cage contains my
company's future, after all.

532
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:19,658
Nothing sells war planes
like a new threat from the air.

533
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm sure the Queen will agree

534
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:26,099
especially after Vanosian
terrorists bombed my exhibition!

535
00:34:26,874 --> 00:34:28,532
Did you have a hand in that?

536
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:33,444
The one Harrington who was never
supposed to set foot on an airplane again?

537
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:39,614
I have nothing to do with the
bombs, or the terrorists, or even you.

538
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:42,350
I just wanted to save Ortha.

539
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,010
Save who?

540
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:48,172
The beast. Her name is Ortha.

541
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:50,108
And she's not an animal.

542
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:52,642
She feared for her life
when the bombs went off

543
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:55,337
Cal needed my help
to get her out of danger.

544
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:59,025
She speaks with her
mind, and only I can hear it!

545
00:35:03,096 --> 00:35:07,321
The bombs must have rung your pretty
little bell quite hard, Ms. Harrington.

546
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,967
I remember you as a young girl

547
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:13,667
far too clever to be such a terrible liar.

548
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:18,271
When your expedition reached
the coast of her homeland

549
00:35:18,454 --> 00:35:21,520
it was YOU who opened fire ON THEM.

550
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,882
You didn't even consider the
possibility that they might be a people!

551
00:35:25,994 --> 00:35:29,450
You wiped them out of the
sky, just because you could!

552
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,426
Tell me, does the Queen
know you're a war criminal?

553
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:37,961
Who told you that?

554
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:41,666
-Cal?
-No sir! I didn't, I swear!

555
00:35:41,846 --> 00:35:43,974
He's right. Ortha did!

556
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:49,512
This is not a game, Miss Harrington!

557
00:35:49,575 --> 00:35:53,410
If you don't want to hear the
truth, why do you even ask?

558
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:57,724
I don't take kindly to
terrorists on my ship.

559
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,960
Take her into custody.

560
00:36:02,141 --> 00:36:05,290
Strip her down, and see if
she's got any explosives on her.

561
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,304
What?!

562
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:09,084
Then take her to Dr. McKenzie.

563
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:12,293
He knows how to make people talk.

564
00:36:12,488 --> 00:36:13,488
Yes, sir.

565
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:15,649
Wait!

566
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:19,488
Cal! You must set her free!

567
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:22,290
She remembers how you treated her wounds

568
00:36:22,564 --> 00:36:25,176
how you... How you tried to protect her…

569
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:27,678
and how you tried to soothe
her when she was scared

570
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:29,870
she knows how much you like her.

571
00:36:29,978 --> 00:36:32,181
She says thanks for all the fish!

572
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,945
She is going to sing like a little bird
at the mere sight of the knives, sir.

573
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:52,832
Something is very odd about her.

574
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:56,373
She doesn't seem that insane.

575
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,121
Sir? You think she didn't make it all up?

576
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:05,299
You're going to stay
here and stand guard, Cal.

577
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,772
Don't let anybody near the cage.

578
00:37:07,844 --> 00:37:09,524
Of course, Mr. Welsh.

579
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:16,559
I'll be upstairs. Doctor McKenzie can
sometimes be a little too enthusiastic.

580
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:19,640
Of course. Have a good day, Mr. Welsh.

581
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
The fish…

582
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:34,631
nobody... Nobody knows I stole the fish

583
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:37,795
how the hell does Florence know about it?

584
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:39,471
Can she really

585
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:42,137
talk to Ortha?

586
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:46,443
Ortha?

587
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:49,986
Is that really your name?

588
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:56,565
Fuck me backwards!

589
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:04,334
In all the time I've spent with you,
how could I've been so blind?!

590
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,295
You're...

591
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:25,122
You are not the beast.

592
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,743
Ortha, I'm the beast.

593
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Fuck me.

594
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,588
Fuck me!

595
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:37,528
Look at me!

596
00:38:39,254 --> 00:38:40,238
I…

597
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:42,326
I didn't... Didn't know you're a person!

598
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,039
I thought I was keeping you safe!

599
00:38:44,063 --> 00:38:46,396
I didn't want you to be a prisoner!

600
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:48,158
I'm so sorry! I...

601
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:52,471
I love you Ortha! I really do!

602
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,012
Now I'm crying like a little girl.

603
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:02,267
Please, please don't tell anybody, ok?

604
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,951
Welsh is going to rip my head off.

605
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:14,995
But if I owe you anything, then it's this.

606
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:25,447
There. You're free. Go!

607
00:39:26,677 --> 00:39:27,913
I said go!

608
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,505
What are you waiting for?

609
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:34,099
Oh...

610
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:36,889
Florence's scarf?

611
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:41,046
Yes! Yes, I get it! I will, yes.

612
00:39:42,224 --> 00:39:44,083
Now go! GO!

613
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:09,386
[applause]

614
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:14,005
[Phone rings]

615
00:40:15,492 --> 00:40:17,079
[Phone rings]

616
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,460
The Port Ospen Telegraph,
Emmet Crawford speaking.

617
00:40:21,142 --> 00:40:22,876
Yes, I'm the chief editor…

618
00:40:23,956 --> 00:40:24,956
George who?

619
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:29,375
No. No, we do not reveal our sources

620
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:32,152
No, what kind of newspaper
do you take us for?

621
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:35,877
Cause we adhere to the
journalistic code of ethics!

622
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:40,444
Yes, by all means, go get that
court order if you want to.

623
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:44,589
Yeah, yeah. Have a good day, sir.

624
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,578
Come in!

625
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:51,009
Excuse me, Mr. Crawford?

626
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,018
Oh, it's you.

627
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,983
Listen, if you're here to pitch
the Harrington & Welsh story again

628
00:40:58,008 --> 00:40:59,482
save your breath, kid.

629
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:02,608
That's at least one size
too big for a first year trainee!

630
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:04,374
Please, boss, hear me out.

631
00:41:04,566 --> 00:41:06,315
I've done some more
research, and I really…

632
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,854
No, Julian

633
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,957
why don't you do something useful?

634
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:14,390
After the recent attack, the Obituary
department needs all help they can get.

635
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:18,093
With all due respect, sir, I
came here to be a journalist

636
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:20,362
and the Telegraph is an institution.

637
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:22,144
Forgive me for eavesdropping

638
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,446
but I heard how strongly you
defended your source on the phone!

639
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,827
Please, give me a chance!

640
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:28,962
*sigh* All right, all right!

641
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:30,852
But just remember this

642
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:37,376
appealing to my sense of journalistic pride
will work exactly once in your career here

643
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,506
so you'd better make it count!

644
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:41,321
Now, what you got?

645
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:43,508
I'm sure I'm onto something.

646
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,300
Shortly after the death
of Peter M. Harrington

647
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:50,384
Sarkan T. Welsh bought out the
other half of the company from his wife.

648
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:54,650
The moment he had sole ownership,
he immediately changed the company's direction.

649
00:41:54,904 --> 00:41:57,545
He diversified, founded a
weapons department, and

650
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,819
bought out a number of smaller
companies in the automotive

651
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:03,250
telegraph and telephone business.

652
00:42:03,536 --> 00:42:06,965
And did you notice there were no
terrorist attacks before the buyout?

653
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:09,130
Oh, that's all public knowledge.

654
00:42:09,289 --> 00:42:14,382
And it's not surprising, we were
heading directly into a war with Vanos.

655
00:42:14,854 --> 00:42:17,365
You're mixing up cause and effect!

656
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:20,589
But also, Eva Harrington
sold the part of the company

657
00:42:20,614 --> 00:42:24,286
she had inherited from her
husband way under price!

658
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,649
Well, I guess she's not a very
capable negotiator then, eh?

659
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:31,517
Don't waste my time, Julian!

660
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:32,854
Where's the scoop?

661
00:42:32,874 --> 00:42:37,812
I compiled all the reports and eyewitness accounts
of the most recent attack at the airfield.

662
00:42:37,845 --> 00:42:42,056
And they lead me to believe that Florence
Harrington is currently on board of the airship.

663
00:42:42,122 --> 00:42:43,431
Eye witnesses?

664
00:42:43,571 --> 00:42:47,682
Why, eye witnesses make good
headlines, but it's all hearsay, eh?

665
00:42:48,488 --> 00:42:49,928
Where is the proof?

666
00:42:50,006 --> 00:42:51,877
Boss, look at the big picture!

667
00:42:51,957 --> 00:42:55,367
Something isn't right, and
I want to find out what it is.

668
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,009
Please, please let me!

669
00:42:57,073 --> 00:42:59,806
Isn't that what good
journalism is all about?

670
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,199
All right

671
00:43:02,305 --> 00:43:05,245
I hoped you'd figure this out by yourself

672
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,385
let me tell you something
about journalism, hm?

673
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:11,341
Sit down, kid.

674
00:43:18,103 --> 00:43:19,103
Now, Julian.

675
00:43:19,578 --> 00:43:22,584
You know who pays you, right?

676
00:43:23,379 --> 00:43:25,215
Yes, the company?

677
00:43:25,463 --> 00:43:28,879
Riiight! And who pays the company?

678
00:43:29,495 --> 00:43:31,646
Uhm… our subscribers?

679
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:35,669
And our advertisers. Which are?

680
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:38,043
I don't know.

681
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,978
And you call yourself an investigator!

682
00:43:41,276 --> 00:43:43,278
Hah! Snow Chemical

683
00:43:43,577 --> 00:43:45,729
Bank of Astar, Redwood Motors

684
00:43:45,816 --> 00:43:47,374
and Express Telegram.

685
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:52,498
Now guess who owns the
majority of those companies.

686
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,778
*sigh* Harrington & Welsh.

687
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:57,203
And guess what they'll do if we start

688
00:43:57,228 --> 00:44:00,650
snooping around Mr. Welsh's
business practices, huh?

689
00:44:00,697 --> 00:44:02,619
*sigh* They'll no longer pay us…

690
00:44:02,738 --> 00:44:04,405
But if we let that hold us back

691
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,685
doesn't that violate all the
rules of good journalism?

692
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,278
Oh, my boy.

693
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:13,465
Journalism is a job like any other.

694
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:17,484
You work, you get paid,
you can put food on the table.

695
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:22,554
Welsh owns this country, like it or not.

696
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,939
And since I like being able
to feed my wife and kids

697
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:28,908
I don't care what's
right or wrong about that!

698
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,840
Even if you find out

699
00:44:30,912 --> 00:44:34,155
that he's personally fucking
Eva Harrington's daughter

700
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,892
right up there in his
personal mile high club

701
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,984
I don't want to know about it!

702
00:44:40,393 --> 00:44:42,922
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid

703
00:44:43,192 --> 00:44:46,689
but we're a newspaper, not a charity.

704
00:44:47,763 --> 00:44:50,707
Now go and help out
the Obituaries department.

705
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,483
Something tells me they're
going to get even busier…

706
00:44:55,704 --> 00:44:58,851
Neee - naaaa - naaaa - neee - naaaa

707
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:02,349
Naaaa - naaaa - naaaa
-naaaa - nee-naa-naaa

708
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:13,030
Ah! A new customer!

709
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:14,882
How nice!

710
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:18,235
With whom do I have the honor?

711
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:23,068
Her name is Harrington.
Florence Harrington, to be exact.

712
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,170
Welcome to my office, Ms. Harrington.

713
00:45:27,503 --> 00:45:30,150
It is a pleasure to meet you.

714
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,205
Who are you?

715
00:45:36,759 --> 00:45:40,278
My name is Dr. McKenzie

716
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,077
and Truth is my One God.

717
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:46,287
He fears none.

718
00:45:46,635 --> 00:45:48,647
He's without hate.

719
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:50,805
He never dies.

720
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,540
He's beyond the cycle of birth and death.

721
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:57,179
He was True in the beginning.

722
00:45:57,331 --> 00:46:03,028
He was True when the ages
commenced and has ever been True.

723
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:05,738
He is also True now.

724
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,472
Are you ready to meet the One True God?

725
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:10,505
Ah!

726
00:46:12,322 --> 00:46:14,150
McKenzie!

727
00:46:15,569 --> 00:46:17,969
There are two things I need to know.

728
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:22,603
Number one: Why is she really here?

729
00:46:23,668 --> 00:46:28,046
Number two: Who told little miss what
happened during the expedition?

730
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:32,007
And I need you to make sure
she survives the procedure.

731
00:46:32,266 --> 00:46:35,053
Because otherwise I would
have to kill her mother too

732
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,492
and that would make
things really complicated.

733
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:43,111
And I hate when things get complicated.

734
00:46:43,736 --> 00:46:46,438
Better don't even leave any marks.

735
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:49,320
Absolutely.

736
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:58,057
Who in their right mind could cut up
such a beautiful young face anyways?

737
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:03,446
I'm looking forward to the
report, mister McKenzie.

738
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:06,973
What...

739
00:47:06,997 --> 00:47:08,550
What are you going to do to me?

740
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:12,900
Oh… that depends entirely on you.

741
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:17,449
If I need to know is the truth,
all I need to know is the truth.

742
00:47:17,496 --> 00:47:20,858
And it will all be over in a minute.

743
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:23,698
Mr. Welsh said you're
not allowed to injure me!

744
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,841
And I don't have to!

745
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:35,656
This here, for example

746
00:47:36,683 --> 00:47:41,365
is a fresh dose of red
shoelace snake venom.

747
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:46,238
It's like a fine wine for
the connoisseur of pain.

748
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:51,974
It starts off light,
ephemeral, almost fruity.

749
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:56,532
Like a tiny spark singeing
the fur on your arms.

750
00:47:56,648 --> 00:48:00,600
After a while, that will make
way for a more rich

751
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:06,404
hearty, slightly crunchy taste of pain.

752
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:10,206
Not unlike to getting your
tail mashed in a revolving door.

753
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:14,290
And it will keep growing,
bold and unrelenting.

754
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:19,679
Like somebody is using a drill to
excavate your ingrown toe claw!

755
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:24,626
And then, finally, the
world will cease to exist

756
00:48:24,627 --> 00:48:30,188
and there is nothing
but pure, intense, brilliant pain!

757
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:40,789
Now, are you going to talk to me or not?

758
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:41,814
[knocking]

759
00:48:41,973 --> 00:48:43,165
Uhhh

760
00:48:44,728 --> 00:48:48,500
What the hell is it?
I am serving a customer!

761
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,257
[door opens]

762
00:48:53,627 --> 00:48:56,198
You ordered coffee, Sir?

763
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,204
No, I didn't! Are you new here?

764
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:02,347
I hate coffee!

765
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,706
Oh, uh, in that case I guess

766
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:06,623
I don't NEED IT ANYMORE

767
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:09,117
Aargh! The pain!

768
00:49:09,986 --> 00:49:11,731
It's so good...

769
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,499
Enjoy it while it lasts, pervert!

770
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
What?

771
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:26,223
Cal!

772
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:28,054
Oh, uh, yeah

773
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:33,563
C... Cal!

774
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:35,378
Yes, that's my name.

775
00:49:35,535 --> 00:49:38,146
All right, you need to get out of here.

776
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:39,346
Quickly!

777
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:45,665
Cal

778
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:49,106
I'm so glad that Ortha was right about you.

779
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:50,811
Let's get... Over with

780
00:49:51,117 --> 00:49:52,987
before someone smells the rat

781
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,696
We don't have time for sentimental drivel.

782
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,612
You're free now, come!

783
00:49:57,637 --> 00:49:58,588
Thank you, Cal.

784
00:49:58,613 --> 00:50:02,167
Don't thank me too early, because you
and I are basically dead men walking

785
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:04,545
unless we get off this ship real fast!

786
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:05,969
What about Ortha?

787
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,907
I let her go, and she flew away.

788
00:50:07,932 --> 00:50:09,961
Wow! You really did that?

789
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:14,618
Listen girl, there are two airplanes
in the back, fueled and ready to go.

790
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:17,068
I hope your daddy taught you
well to fly these

791
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:19,052
because I can't!

792
00:50:20,003 --> 00:50:22,942
WHAT? But I've never
flown a plane alone before!

793
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:26,356
We have the choice between dying
up here, or maybe not dying down there.

794
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:28,556
But we can't just steal a plane!

795
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:31,524
Of course we can! No more
excuses. We have to go.

796
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:35,094
-Go, Go, Go, Go!
-All right! All right! Stop pushing me!

797
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,930
[applause]

798
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:39,888
Down the hallway, then right!

799
00:50:39,986 --> 00:50:42,049
No, left! That's a shorter way!

800
00:50:42,065 --> 00:50:43,074
How the fuck...

801
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:45,477
Trust me, I've studied
the plans a thousand times

802
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:47,369
I know this ship inside out!

803
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:48,709
[BONK]

804
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:50,700
Ouch! My Head!

805
00:50:50,866 --> 00:50:52,394
Ah, so much for that!

806
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:55,375
They must've made a
few revisions since then...

807
00:50:56,288 --> 00:50:58,721
Will you... Ever... Shut up?

808
00:50:59,654 --> 00:51:01,411
Hey you! Stop!

809
00:51:01,483 --> 00:51:03,339
The lower decks have been sealed off.

810
00:51:03,379 --> 00:51:05,623
Security Reasons. I can not let you pass!

811
00:51:05,637 --> 00:51:07,900
Uh, but I have a special
permit from Mr. Welsh.

812
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:09,282
Oh really? Can I see it?

813
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,330
Oh yeah, sure!

814
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:11,799
[BONK]

815
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,943
Ouch, ouch, auch, ouch, aahh…

816
00:51:16,017 --> 00:51:18,742
What the hell is going on down there?

817
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,293
Shit, that didn't go well. Runrunrun!!!!

818
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,247
All right. Lock the door!

819
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:37,539
No use, it only locks from the other side.

820
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,820
But it'll take a moment
to get us ready for takeoff.

821
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:43,515
Then shut up and do it!

822
00:51:48,962 --> 00:51:51,785
Seats Belts: Closed and Locked

823
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,363
Brakes: Who gives a damn

824
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:56,534
Circuit breakers: In

825
00:51:56,709 --> 00:51:58,677
Master Switch: On

826
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:01,155
Are you done yet?

827
00:52:01,195 --> 00:52:03,648
I'm not even half way
through the check list!

828
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,726
What? Check list?

829
00:52:05,933 --> 00:52:07,987
We don't have time for shit like that!

830
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:12,719
The pre-flight checklist is essential to
make sure no important tasks are forgotten!

831
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:15,522
The only important task is
to get the fuck out of here!

832
00:52:15,586 --> 00:52:17,358
Can you open the bay doors?

833
00:52:17,422 --> 00:52:18,422
Uh...

834
00:52:19,153 --> 00:52:20,153
I'll try!

835
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:24,050
Fuel shutoff valve: On

836
00:52:24,404 --> 00:52:26,424
Propeller area: Check

837
00:52:26,531 --> 00:52:28,345
Magnetos: Check

838
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,289
Ignition: Start

839
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,980
Throttle: 1000 rpm

840
00:52:37,248 --> 00:52:39,191
Oil Pressure: Normal

841
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:41,461
Radios: On

842
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:43,992
Now we're talking!

843
00:52:44,017 --> 00:52:46,242
Altimeter: Set

844
00:52:46,321 --> 00:52:48,321
Fuel Quantity: Check

845
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:51,355
Autopilot: I wish

846
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:54,067
Suction gauge: Check

847
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,303
Engine Instruments: Check

848
00:52:56,334 --> 00:52:58,307
Strobe Lights: On

849
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,999
Now is the time to show
what you are made of!

850
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,242
And I hope it's not cake!

851
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,556
Buckle up and hold on to your butt!

852
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:07,357
Ah?

853
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:09,976
Passenger briefing: Complete!

854
00:53:11,245 --> 00:53:14,596
Aiiiiiiieiieieieiieieieieiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!

855
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:26,215
[gunshots]

856
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:33,880
[applause]

857
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:37,887
Uhh, Florence?

858
00:53:38,702 --> 00:53:39,702
Um...

859
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:41,179
Florence!

860
00:53:41,815 --> 00:53:42,815
Florence?

861
00:53:43,881 --> 00:53:45,241
Are we there yet?

862
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:46,539
Where?

863
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:48,439
Wherever we are going!

864
00:53:48,534 --> 00:53:51,967
All I know right now is that
we're somewhere above the sea.

865
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:53,405
The western sea?

866
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,297
I sure hope so, because
we're heading east.

867
00:53:57,164 --> 00:54:00,171
Uhh, it's not going to get
any more specific than that?

868
00:54:00,378 --> 00:54:01,751
What do you expect?

869
00:54:01,776 --> 00:54:03,435
It's pitch black out there.

870
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:08,105
I have no landmarks, no coastline,
only the goddamn compass.

871
00:54:08,232 --> 00:54:12,248
If we manage to reach the shore,
maybe we can spot something we know, like

872
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:14,229
the lighthouse at Port Ospen.

873
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:19,457
But until then, no, it's not going
to get any more specific than that.

874
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:23,268
Harrington & Welsh Airlines is
terribly sorry for the inconvenience

875
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,835
and our customer service
will gladly give you a full refund!

876
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:31,402
It's - it's just that our fuel
won't last forever, you know?

877
00:54:31,577 --> 00:54:33,285
Look, Mr. Smartypants

878
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,376
I'm enough of a nervous wreck already

879
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,278
so will you please JUST … SHUT … UP?

880
00:54:39,098 --> 00:54:40,098
Coward.

881
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:41,678
Asshole.

882
00:54:42,127 --> 00:54:43,127
HRMPF!

883
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:58,150
Um... Cal? Cal?

884
00:54:58,325 --> 00:55:01,784
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to snap at you like that.

885
00:55:01,945 --> 00:55:03,281
Oh, fuck you!

886
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:05,466
I'm thankful you saved me.

887
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:06,550
Really!

888
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:08,325
I'm just also very…

889
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,470
very scared.

890
00:55:09,716 --> 00:55:12,777
I'm shaking so much I can
barely fly in a straight line!

891
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,678
Huh! Well, too bad for you!

892
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:18,597
Come on!

893
00:55:18,622 --> 00:55:20,784
You love to talk big like a man

894
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,111
but the moment someone
dares to come back at you

895
00:55:23,136 --> 00:55:25,799
you stomp off in a huff
like an injured prima donna!

896
00:55:25,824 --> 00:55:28,062
-Ah, right!
-If you're trying to pretend

897
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:29,933
this doesn't affect you at all

898
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,887
you're doing a pretty bad job.

899
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:33,960
You're just as frightened as I am.

900
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:35,568
Woah, if you say so.

901
00:55:37,082 --> 00:55:41,281
What makes it so hard for you to
admit that you actually have a heart?

902
00:55:41,413 --> 00:55:42,853
The heart is weak.

903
00:55:42,985 --> 00:55:45,477
Strength and intelligence makes you a man.

904
00:55:45,502 --> 00:55:49,790
Unbelievable! It's like you WANT
people to think you're an asshole.

905
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:54,060
You saved my life.
And you set Ortha free.

906
00:55:54,259 --> 00:55:56,525
If that didn't come from the heart

907
00:55:56,593 --> 00:56:01,009
what kind of manly rational bargain
were you hoping to get out of it?

908
00:56:01,432 --> 00:56:03,899
I think we can rule out job security.

909
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:06,468
What the fuck did you want from me?

910
00:56:06,962 --> 00:56:10,884
I don't have to justify
myself to you or something.

911
00:56:11,713 --> 00:56:15,926
I just had hoped there's at least a
little bit of compassion left in you.

912
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:18,046
That's a good thing, you know?

913
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:28,029
[radio] *crackle*
Hotel-Whiskey-3-2-9 - do you read me?

914
00:56:28,101 --> 00:56:31,250
Hotel-Whiskey-3-2-9 - do you read me?

915
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:34,411
Ah, nono, don't - don't answer them!

916
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,648
Don't they already know where we are?

917
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:40,110
*crackle* Hotel-Whiskey-3-2-9, we
have located you by your radio beacon.

918
00:56:40,142 --> 00:56:43,598
We are now going to escort
you to Port Ospen Airfield.

919
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,985
*crackle* Reduce airspeed immediately.

920
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:49,473
What are they going to do if we don't?

921
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:51,729
Well, first they'll hunt us down.

922
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,606
And then they will kill us.

923
00:56:53,631 --> 00:56:56,741
Ah, oh, and your mother, too, if
they didn't do that already.

924
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,274
Are you kidding me?

925
00:56:58,306 --> 00:56:59,587
I wish I were.

926
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:03,540
This isn't funny! What the hell
has my mother to do with all this?

927
00:57:03,565 --> 00:57:05,104
More than you think.

928
00:57:05,343 --> 00:57:08,932
You'd better talk straight to me,
or I will personally throw you…

929
00:57:08,964 --> 00:57:09,981
-out of this...
-come on, you...

930
00:57:10,005 --> 00:57:12,658
*crackle* Hotel-Whiskey-3-2-9,
the Harrington & Welsh company has

931
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:15,525
the exclusive air sovereignty
over the skies of Astar

932
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,773
and we have authority to use
any means necessary to stop you.

933
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:20,405
This is our final warning.

934
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:22,961
Okay, this is it. I'm giving up.

935
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:25,384
No! Don't fall for it!

936
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,630
They think you're a terrorist from Vanos!

937
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:32,143
Once we get in their
firing range, we're toast!

938
00:57:32,168 --> 00:57:34,040
I'm not a goddamn fighter pilot!

939
00:57:34,065 --> 00:57:35,931
I'm not even a normal pilot!

940
00:57:36,134 --> 00:57:37,780
Ah, shut up and fly!

941
00:57:37,805 --> 00:57:38,805
Oh shit!

942
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,143
Hotel-Whiskey-0-0-1,
Hotel-Whiskey-3-3-0 reporting

943
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:02,241
radio silence from Hotel-Whiskey-3-2-9.

944
00:58:02,273 --> 00:58:04,406
Requesting further instructions.

945
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:10,541
Hotel-Whiskey-3-3-0, rogue
pilot is a Vanosian terrorist.

946
00:58:10,573 --> 00:58:13,258
Keep the plane from falling
into the enemy's hands.

947
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:17,880
Deadly force authorized.
Repeat: Deadly force authorized.

948
00:58:17,924 --> 00:58:21,263
Roger Hotel-Whiskey-0-0-1,
I'm on their tail!

949
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:44,553
[gunshots]

950
00:58:44,578 --> 00:58:45,578
Oh shit!

951
00:58:45,863 --> 00:58:46,863
[screams]

952
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:51,263
Aaahhh!

953
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,538
[gunshots]

954
00:58:56,018 --> 00:58:57,340
Aaaah! Aaaah!

955
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:02,164
[gunshots]

956
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:14,579
Hotel-Whiskey-3-3-0, Stop shooting!

957
00:59:14,678 --> 00:59:17,343
We surrender! I repeat: We surrender!

958
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:18,617
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

959
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:20,667
NO, I JUST DON'T WANT TO DIE!

960
00:59:20,692 --> 00:59:22,978
BUT NOW WE ARE GOING TO DIE!

961
00:59:26,107 --> 00:59:29,109
Hotel-Whiskey-3-2-9, good to
hear you've regained your voice.

962
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:32,802
Let me catch up and I'll escort
you to Port Ospen airfield.

963
00:59:33,193 --> 00:59:36,713
Try anything funny, and I
will blow you out of the sky.

964
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:40,988
Hotel-Whiskey-3-3-0, roger, will comply.

965
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:45,379
I don't think they are going to wreck one
of their own planes if they don't have to.

966
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:49,095
You naive little fool! Welsh
doesn't give a fuck about the plane!

967
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,255
Ahh, he cares about
me, and the things I know!

968
00:59:52,296 --> 00:59:54,729
Oh, it's always about you, isn't it?

969
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:59,176
But it fucking is! I know a lot
of things most people don't.

970
00:59:59,216 --> 01:00:02,368
Welsh used to trust me
like a member of his family, but now

971
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,121
I'm on a plane with the enemy!

972
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:05,884
Do you realize what that means?

973
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:08,299
And you gave all this up… for what?

974
01:00:12,836 --> 01:00:16,269
[gunshots, screams]

975
01:00:16,294 --> 01:00:20,185
What are you doing? You promised
us to stop shooting if we surrendered!

976
01:00:21,399 --> 01:00:25,344
*laughs* What did you expect?
A slap on the wrist, and no dessert?

977
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:29,209
We don't negotiate with terrorists!
DIE, VANOSIAN SCUM! DIE!

978
01:00:29,252 --> 01:00:33,452
[gunshots]

979
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:35,639
Aaaah!

980
01:00:37,451 --> 01:00:39,159
Oh shit! We lost the rudder!

981
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:40,879
Oil Pressure's falling …

982
01:00:41,435 --> 01:00:43,578
Our damn tail's on fire!

983
01:00:43,937 --> 01:00:46,110
Ahh... this is really bad…

984
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:51,237
The Harrington & Welsh
company wishes you a safe landing! *laugh*

985
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:55,015
[gunshots]

986
01:01:01,793 --> 01:01:02,650
Ortha?

987
01:01:02,691 --> 01:01:03,982
WHAT THE FUCK?

988
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,070
AAAAAAARGH!

989
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:08,252
AAAAAAAAAAH!

990
01:01:10,491 --> 01:01:11,851
Ortha!

991
01:01:12,605 --> 01:01:14,541
Over here!

992
01:01:17,198 --> 01:01:18,785
What the hell?

993
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:24,368
Your flying machine looks unhappy…

994
01:01:24,439 --> 01:01:26,699
Help meeeeee!

995
01:01:26,834 --> 01:01:30,011
-Waaaaa...
-We're not far from the shore.

996
01:01:30,143 --> 01:01:34,111
I think I can carry you…
but only one at a time.

997
01:01:36,336 --> 01:01:39,824
I don't think this thing will
keep flying long enough!

998
01:01:40,934 --> 01:01:41,934
Florence?

999
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,955
Florence! Why aren't you saying anything?

1000
01:01:44,998 --> 01:01:47,351
Shut up! I'm talking to Ortha!

1001
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,885
Uh, ok. And what does she say?

1002
01:01:49,933 --> 01:01:52,877
She says… that you
have to use the parachute!

1003
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,730
-Eh...
-What?

1004
01:01:53,754 --> 01:01:55,434
-Hey, that's not what I said…
-She will

1005
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:58,866
carry me to the ground,
and then pick you out of the water.

1006
01:01:58,898 --> 01:02:01,579
Oh, I can totally do that!

1007
01:02:01,712 --> 01:02:03,712
I have very good night vision!

1008
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:06,701
Uh, and why me?

1009
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:09,781
Because you're a strong
man! You can handle it!

1010
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,536
Um, yeah, sure! But uh...

1011
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:15,407
it looks kinda wet down there, you know...

1012
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:17,895
Come on Ortha, let's go!

1013
01:02:20,377 --> 01:02:21,377
What?

1014
01:02:21,689 --> 01:02:22,689
Hey!

1015
01:02:23,057 --> 01:02:25,634
Oh, are you sure he will be allright?

1016
01:02:25,737 --> 01:02:28,957
Oh yes. A little cool down
will do him good…

1017
01:02:29,936 --> 01:02:30,936
Hey!

1018
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:34,951
So that's what I get for getting you
out of that cage, you goddamn bitch!

1019
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,576
Uhh, all right then…

1020
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:41,081
one… two…

1021
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:43,187
two and a half…

1022
01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:45,814
three…

1023
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:47,084
two…

1024
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:48,309
Ohhh...

1025
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,268
oh fuck it!

1026
01:02:50,307 --> 01:02:52,941
Geronimoooo!

1027
01:02:55,429 --> 01:03:02,517
[applause]

1028
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:08,601
[BOOM]

1029
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:10,931
[BOOM]

1030
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:28,131
[applause]

1031
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,502
[door opens]

1032
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:30,752
Mr. French!

1033
01:03:30,871 --> 01:03:32,355
Mrs. Harrington!

1034
01:03:32,435 --> 01:03:34,768
I've been waiting for you! Come in!

1035
01:03:34,998 --> 01:03:37,458
And? Did you get a call from Florence?

1036
01:03:37,499 --> 01:03:39,139
I'm afraid I didn't.

1037
01:03:39,354 --> 01:03:42,618
*SIGH* I thought this was
just one of her escapades

1038
01:03:42,713 --> 01:03:44,914
but she's been gone for a whole day now!

1039
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,125
I wish there was anything I could do

1040
01:03:47,189 --> 01:03:49,342
but I can't leave the shop during the day.

1041
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,464
Especially not when I'm a woman short.

1042
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:53,112
And you don't have to.

1043
01:03:53,207 --> 01:03:56,151
I called a few friends,
and I did some research.

1044
01:03:56,421 --> 01:03:58,103
And what did you find out?

1045
01:03:58,175 --> 01:04:00,862
I've got good news and bad news.

1046
01:04:00,998 --> 01:04:03,605
And I've got a short
temper and a rolling pin

1047
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:05,715
if you give me another cliché like that.

1048
01:04:05,755 --> 01:04:07,115
Alright, alright.

1049
01:04:07,413 --> 01:04:10,213
The airship has not returned to Port Ospen

1050
01:04:10,436 --> 01:04:15,365
and there's a rumor Mr. Welsh himself is keeping
the airship in a holding pattern off shore

1051
01:04:15,682 --> 01:04:18,299
to keep himself safe from further attacks.

1052
01:04:18,395 --> 01:04:22,477
You mean Florence is stuck
on the ship with Mr. Welsh?

1053
01:04:22,882 --> 01:04:25,016
Please let that be the bad news!

1054
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:26,791
That was the good news

1055
01:04:26,847 --> 01:04:29,583
because it explains
why she is still missing.

1056
01:04:29,738 --> 01:04:31,418
But the ship has a radio.

1057
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:34,551
It would have been a simple
thing to send a message.

1058
01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:37,426
Have you tried calling
H&W Headquarters?

1059
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:38,766
Yeah, of course I did.

1060
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,567
They referred me to
their official statement, and

1061
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:43,581
just refused any further help.

1062
01:04:43,653 --> 01:04:46,513
So what is their official statement?

1063
01:04:46,569 --> 01:04:49,098
Please don't grab the rolling pin now, but…

1064
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:50,881
Here come the bad news.

1065
01:04:51,295 --> 01:04:53,295
I checked with a friend at ANR

1066
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,482
and the official statement is that
there is an ongoing investigation against

1067
01:04:57,507 --> 01:04:59,507
a group of vanosian terrorists

1068
01:04:59,853 --> 01:05:03,901
and that a suspect is being held
in custody on board the airship.

1069
01:05:04,028 --> 01:05:06,480
And you think they
might mean Florence?

1070
01:05:06,496 --> 01:05:09,225
But she would never do anything like that!

1071
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:11,588
I'm convinved she only wanted to help.

1072
01:05:11,613 --> 01:05:13,455
But she hates Welsh.

1073
01:05:13,734 --> 01:05:17,235
So he has every reason to
doubt her good intentions.

1074
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:18,862
*sigh* Welsh!

1075
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,986
Schemers like him always think
everybody's as treacherous as they are.

1076
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:26,117
Mr. Welsh? You know him, huh?

1077
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:27,485
I wish I didn't.

1078
01:05:27,566 --> 01:05:30,946
Oh yeah, that's right. He bought your
husband's company, didn't he?

1079
01:05:31,026 --> 01:05:32,960
I'd rather not talk about it.

1080
01:05:33,127 --> 01:05:37,874
I just really, REALLY don't want
Florence anywhere near him.

1081
01:05:38,121 --> 01:05:39,801
Or on any of his planes.

1082
01:05:40,035 --> 01:05:43,107
I'm sorry, Mrs. Harrington,
I didn't mean to pry.

1083
01:05:43,281 --> 01:05:45,407
It's good to know you care.

1084
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:47,176
Could you do me a favor?

1085
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:48,193
Of course!

1086
01:05:48,218 --> 01:05:52,066
Please call me Eva. And
may I call you Abraham?

1087
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:55,114
Abe. My friends call me Abe.

1088
01:05:55,337 --> 01:05:58,587
I'm so touched by all the
support you’re giving me, Abe.

1089
01:05:58,835 --> 01:06:03,827
And since I've had little to do but
worry, I made you a little thank you gift.

1090
01:06:03,945 --> 01:06:06,824
Awwww! Caramel Chocolates!

1091
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,617
Thank you, Eva!

1092
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:11,051
How did you know these were my favorites?

1093
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:13,118
I have my sources, too!

1094
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:17,990
Now it would be a crying shame to go
back home and eat these all by myself.

1095
01:06:18,216 --> 01:06:19,514
-Oh?
-Yes, I might

1096
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:21,775
gain a tremendous amount of weight!

1097
01:06:21,886 --> 01:06:24,951
And besides, if Florence does call

1098
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:27,429
you should be there to talk to her.

1099
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:29,347
That does make sense.

1100
01:06:29,544 --> 01:06:32,982
But I still have to do the cash
check and tidy up the place.

1101
01:06:33,007 --> 01:06:35,429
I can help you with
the cleaning if you want.

1102
01:06:35,509 --> 01:06:40,323
After the incident at the airfield
my shop was practically deserted anyway.

1103
01:06:40,475 --> 01:06:41,755
You're too kind.

1104
01:06:41,851 --> 01:06:43,994
Anything for a lovely lady!

1105
01:06:44,654 --> 01:06:46,669
Well then… come this way.

1106
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:50,021
If you're as handy with a
mop as you are with a wrench

1107
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,026
we should be done in no time!

1108
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:05,257
[applause]

1109
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:10,952
Ortha?

1110
01:07:11,245 --> 01:07:13,708
Ortha! Over here!

1111
01:07:14,794 --> 01:07:15,794
Argh! ugh …

1112
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:21,024
Cal! You made it! Are you alright?

1113
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:25,054
I thought I was freezing to death!

1114
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,347
W - Where the hell are we?

1115
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:34,566
I can barely see the
lighthouse in the north, I think.

1116
01:07:34,614 --> 01:07:39,657
Oh great. I hope Vanos is as
safe as they say these days.

1117
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:43,175
There seems to be a small farm nearby.

1118
01:07:43,613 --> 01:07:46,147
Maybe they will let you stay over night!

1119
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:48,949
And there's still some light in the house!

1120
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:50,111
Let's go!

1121
01:07:51,379 --> 01:07:54,132
No! No! We're fugitives!

1122
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:56,067
What if they report us?

1123
01:07:56,356 --> 01:07:59,245
We're going to hide in the
barn and be off before sunrise!

1124
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:01,418
They'll never know we were there.

1125
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:07,793
Ahh, damn, it's locked.

1126
01:08:08,023 --> 01:08:09,543
That means we have to break in!

1127
01:08:09,623 --> 01:08:11,143
But that's illegal!

1128
01:08:11,274 --> 01:08:14,764
The fact we're still
breathing is illegal, ok?

1129
01:08:15,836 --> 01:08:16,938
Look over there!

1130
01:08:16,978 --> 01:08:19,311
That drain pipe! That will be our way in.

1131
01:08:19,612 --> 01:08:21,531
Oh, that's just stupid.

1132
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:24,117
-I'll just walk over and knock-
-No!

1133
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:27,319
You're going to wait right here!

1134
01:08:28,096 --> 01:08:29,376
Bloody women …

1135
01:08:49,036 --> 01:08:53,078
You need something done,
you've got to do it yourself.

1136
01:08:54,257 --> 01:08:55,905
I'm already wet to the bones, so

1137
01:08:55,937 --> 01:08:58,337
what could possibly go wrong?

1138
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,280
Uh-oh...

1139
01:09:12,442 --> 01:09:13,837
Ew! Gross!

1140
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:19,244
Is it going to stop
Caligula, the Savior?

1141
01:09:19,425 --> 01:09:23,647
No! It will only make him stronger!

1142
01:09:29,862 --> 01:09:30,862
Blergh!

1143
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,434
Cat-eating tentacles!

1144
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:48,556
Aaah, tentacle-eating rats!

1145
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:53,070
Eh, that was...

1146
01:09:55,947 --> 01:09:57,181
That was weird!

1147
01:09:57,826 --> 01:10:00,156
I enjoyed that more than I should have!

1148
01:10:01,713 --> 01:10:05,005
Thank you for helping
me, my friend! Uh? Friends?

1149
01:10:05,354 --> 01:10:06,354
Aaaaagrh!

1150
01:10:10,269 --> 01:10:13,038
So much for being nice for a change.

1151
01:10:18,498 --> 01:10:21,539
Damn! This looked so
much easier in the comic books!

1152
01:10:22,868 --> 01:10:25,135
But turning back is not an option.

1153
01:10:25,747 --> 01:10:30,676
Caligula the Savior is not going to make
himself the laughing stock of the party!

1154
01:10:30,735 --> 01:10:33,016
Forward ever, backwards

1155
01:10:33,072 --> 01:10:35,671
nevAAAAAAAAARGH!

1156
01:10:44,303 --> 01:10:46,119
Aaaarhhh!

1157
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:52,929
[applause]

1158
01:10:53,278 --> 01:10:57,303
Aaaarhg, this is so...

1159
01:10:58,643 --> 01:11:00,549
Whait, what is this?

1160
01:11:00,655 --> 01:11:02,619
I just don't really know, I think

1161
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,516
Ah shit!

1162
01:11:31,404 --> 01:11:34,288
Well, that's my humble barn.

1163
01:11:35,021 --> 01:11:37,821
I wish I could offer you
something better, but...

1164
01:11:38,974 --> 01:11:41,508
All we need is a roof above our heads.

1165
01:11:41,855 --> 01:11:44,007
Thank you so much, Will!

1166
01:11:44,109 --> 01:11:46,709
We do value our
hospitality here in Vanos.

1167
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:49,704
Can I invite you for breakfast tomorrow?

1168
01:11:49,783 --> 01:11:53,367
It ain't often a plane
crashes in my backyard!

1169
01:11:53,787 --> 01:11:55,700
Of course!

1170
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:01,509
Now where in tarnation
is that friend of yours?

1171
01:12:02,103 --> 01:12:04,386
Uhm … good question.

1172
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:07,889
When we left, he was just
checking out the drain pipe.

1173
01:12:08,342 --> 01:12:09,342
Drain pipe?

1174
01:12:09,799 --> 01:12:11,999
My barn ain't got a drain!

1175
01:12:13,517 --> 01:12:14,517
Help!

1176
01:12:15,307 --> 01:12:17,492
Heeeelp me!

1177
01:12:18,522 --> 01:12:19,522
Help!

1178
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:20,918
That him?

1179
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,140
I'm afraid so.

1180
01:12:23,396 --> 01:12:27,255
Cal? CAL!? Where are you?

1181
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:29,624
Uh, I'm down here!

1182
01:12:30,022 --> 01:12:31,702
That came from outside…

1183
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:39,369
What the hell are you waiting for?

1184
01:12:41,759 --> 01:12:43,693
Well, I'll be damned…

1185
01:12:43,972 --> 01:12:46,572
What the hell are you doing down there?

1186
01:12:48,649 --> 01:12:52,841
Eh, stop asking stupid
questions and get me out!

1187
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:55,744
I'm on it! Hang in tight!

1188
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:18,645
Allright!

1189
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,534
Who are you, and what
are you doing in my toilet?

1190
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:24,987
Name's Cal.

1191
01:13:25,515 --> 01:13:27,515
Royal pipe inspection service.

1192
01:13:29,484 --> 01:13:33,324
Did you know you have a serious
tentacle problem down there?

1193
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,697
Very funny Cal, very funny!

1194
01:13:36,047 --> 01:13:40,579
But now it's time to GO
INSIDE AND TAKE A NAP!

1195
01:13:53,385 --> 01:13:57,773
I reckon Mr. Pipe Inspector here
surely could use a bath.

1196
01:13:58,137 --> 01:13:59,870
Well, I'll go and get a tub!

1197
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,142
Only if it's not too much trouble!

1198
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,233
Eh

1199
01:14:04,258 --> 01:14:05,258
it's allright!

1200
01:14:05,329 --> 01:14:07,009
I'll be back in a sec.

1201
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:20,844
That was the most embarrassing
thing that ever happened to me!

1202
01:14:21,026 --> 01:14:22,679
-But I…
-No buts!

1203
01:14:22,788 --> 01:14:24,916
-You almost ruined it!
-What?

1204
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:27,885
When will you stop throwing
your goddamn weight around?

1205
01:14:28,021 --> 01:14:30,753
Who are you trying to impress? Me?

1206
01:14:30,847 --> 01:14:33,274
I was... Only... Trying to help!

1207
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,394
You smell like a maggot
infested raccoon

1208
01:14:36,554 --> 01:14:39,154
rotting at the bottom of a rain barrel!

1209
01:14:40,056 --> 01:14:41,532
FOR TWO WEEKS!

1210
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:42,518
No, I...

1211
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:43,566
IN THE SUN!

1212
01:14:43,638 --> 01:14:45,015
Yeah, but... Right, yeah, I

1213
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:46,312
WITH THE LID ON!

1214
01:14:47,173 --> 01:14:48,507
Listen to me!

1215
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:49,736
No!

1216
01:14:49,761 --> 01:14:52,161
How about you just shut up for once?

1217
01:14:52,552 --> 01:14:54,232
Think you can do that?

1218
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,201
Good!

1219
01:15:00,484 --> 01:15:01,484
fuck's sake!

1220
01:15:08,393 --> 01:15:10,040
Don't be so mad at him.

1221
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:12,066
He was just trying to help.

1222
01:15:12,553 --> 01:15:15,487
Oh, you find this pretty funny, don't you?

1223
01:15:16,994 --> 01:15:18,765
Actually … yes!

1224
01:15:19,165 --> 01:15:20,445
Pipe inspector…

1225
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:25,615
Are you picking my mind again?

1226
01:15:26,099 --> 01:15:30,138
No, you're just still thinking very loudly!

1227
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:44,146
Here we are!

1228
01:15:44,567 --> 01:15:46,701
Fresh bath for the deep diver!

1229
01:15:47,391 --> 01:15:49,246
Perfect. Thank you.

1230
01:15:49,271 --> 01:15:50,989
Eh, you're welcome!

1231
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:56,420
Well, time for me to hit the sheets.

1232
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:59,220
I'll be seeing you only
in the morning, allright?

1233
01:16:00,677 --> 01:16:02,638
-Good night, Will!
-Night!

1234
01:16:07,407 --> 01:16:09,617
You know what's funny?

1235
01:16:11,184 --> 01:16:16,146
You two-leggers have fur,
but you're still wearing clothes.

1236
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:17,488
Why's that?

1237
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,775
Oh, there's more than one reason.

1238
01:16:21,031 --> 01:16:24,589
They protect us, they look nice, and…

1239
01:16:25,263 --> 01:16:27,862
they keep things hidden.

1240
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:30,827
What kind of things?

1241
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:31,857
Uhm…

1242
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:35,879
male and female things?

1243
01:16:36,824 --> 01:16:38,365
Oooooh!

1244
01:16:38,445 --> 01:16:41,341
Seeing him naked arouses you!

1245
01:16:41,707 --> 01:16:45,385
ORTHA! Those are my most private feelings!

1246
01:16:49,987 --> 01:16:52,525
Oh, the images…

1247
01:16:53,028 --> 01:16:55,609
so that's how you two-legged people…

1248
01:16:55,817 --> 01:16:57,639
ORTHAAAAAA!

1249
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:05,333
Why are you so ashamed about everything?

1250
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:07,726
I mean, how about you?

1251
01:17:07,977 --> 01:17:11,757
Aren't you curious how
it feels when WE do it?

1252
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:12,821
NO!

1253
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:17,384
Oh, what a shame. It's really good!

1254
01:17:19,445 --> 01:17:22,517
You just don't want me
to sleep tonight, do you?

1255
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,963
Are you two talking about me again?

1256
01:17:29,317 --> 01:17:30,459
Of course.

1257
01:17:30,571 --> 01:17:33,579
The whole world revolves
around you, after all.

1258
01:17:34,879 --> 01:17:36,319
Oh for fucks sake!

1259
01:17:37,095 --> 01:17:39,566
Yes, I screwed up.

1260
01:17:39,662 --> 01:17:42,836
There, I admitted it, is that
what you wanted to hear?

1261
01:17:43,094 --> 01:17:44,134
Well...

1262
01:17:44,311 --> 01:17:45,756
It's a start.

1263
01:17:46,214 --> 01:17:48,248
Fine. Anything else?

1264
01:17:49,427 --> 01:17:51,946
See, he's not so bad!

1265
01:17:52,871 --> 01:17:57,607
Let's see if you can get anything
out of him to open up a little more.

1266
01:17:58,137 --> 01:18:01,147
You would make a great psychotherapist!

1267
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:03,850
Well, I am, in a way.

1268
01:18:05,282 --> 01:18:07,421
So... Cal?

1269
01:18:07,828 --> 01:18:10,134
After you let Ortha free…

1270
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:13,096
why did you come back to rescue me?

1271
01:18:13,364 --> 01:18:16,564
You were my only chance
to get off the ship alive, so...

1272
01:18:18,957 --> 01:18:21,642
I don't think that was the reason.

1273
01:18:21,856 --> 01:18:24,256
Something seemed to cause him grief.

1274
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:26,135
I even saw him crying.

1275
01:18:26,544 --> 01:18:29,591
I had to push him a little
bit in the right direction.

1276
01:18:30,089 --> 01:18:32,613
Cal, be honest with me.

1277
01:18:32,725 --> 01:18:33,966
But I am…

1278
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,410
Wait.

1279
01:18:36,493 --> 01:18:38,338
Damn. Ortha, right?

1280
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:40,425
She told you everything?

1281
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:43,301
Oh yeah, just keep
kicking me while I'm down

1282
01:18:43,334 --> 01:18:45,014
I'm well used to that!

1283
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:48,719
Um...

1284
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,720
Does she… know what I'm saying?

1285
01:18:52,085 --> 01:18:55,258
She understands everything I understand

1286
01:18:55,451 --> 01:18:57,184
as long as we're touching.

1287
01:18:59,103 --> 01:19:01,308
Fucking Brilliant!

1288
01:19:01,777 --> 01:19:05,616
Here I am, naked, smelling like shit

1289
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:10,606
and there are you, with your living
lie detector, judging me smug as fuck.

1290
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:20,363
[laughter, applause]

1291
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:26,623
So much for your moral superiority!

1292
01:19:27,534 --> 01:19:28,924
Oh, I'm sorry!

1293
01:19:28,956 --> 01:19:32,156
It comes naturally, I
didn't think anything of it!

1294
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:36,181
But you're right.

1295
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,500
Whoops.

1296
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,120
I didn't save you to save myself.

1297
01:19:45,959 --> 01:19:48,226
I did it because I owed it to you.

1298
01:19:48,942 --> 01:19:49,942
Both of you.

1299
01:19:50,894 --> 01:19:53,361
I had to make right what I did wrong!

1300
01:19:55,527 --> 01:19:56,967
I love you, Ortha!

1301
01:19:58,067 --> 01:20:01,395
You are the most magnificent
being I have ever seen.

1302
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:05,528
When the bombs exploded, I was
more scared for your life than my own!

1303
01:20:06,154 --> 01:20:09,546
I feel so guilty for not
realizing you are a person!

1304
01:20:10,321 --> 01:20:12,845
I didn't have the right
to keep you in a cage!

1305
01:20:13,084 --> 01:20:17,795
I spent so much time with you, but I
was too blind to see what you really are.

1306
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:22,382
I'm so sorry, Ortha.

1307
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:24,966
I hope you can forgive me.

1308
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,250
Oh!

1309
01:20:28,683 --> 01:20:32,395
So that's what he tried to
tell me back in the cargo hold!

1310
01:20:32,553 --> 01:20:34,525
Oh, If I had only known!

1311
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:36,083
Poor Cal!

1312
01:20:45,801 --> 01:20:48,201
There goes my last shred of dignity.

1313
01:20:48,853 --> 01:20:50,210
Actually

1314
01:20:50,439 --> 01:20:54,121
that was the most dignified
thing I've ever heard you say.

1315
01:20:54,772 --> 01:20:56,972
And of course Ortha forgives you.

1316
01:20:57,548 --> 01:20:59,228
You were very brave!

1317
01:20:59,871 --> 01:21:01,108
Thank you.

1318
01:21:01,316 --> 01:21:02,316
You...

1319
01:21:02,706 --> 01:21:03,913
You too.

1320
01:21:07,011 --> 01:21:08,027
I'm...

1321
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,686
I'm sorry for being so mean to you, I …

1322
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:21,293
What was that? What... What did I do?

1323
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,392
What the hell?!

1324
01:21:23,417 --> 01:21:25,673
Oh no, not again!

1325
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:29,299
Cal… I saw your thoughts!
Your feelings! Everything!

1326
01:21:29,324 --> 01:21:30,324
What?!

1327
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,180
You...

1328
01:21:33,494 --> 01:21:34,494
And...

1329
01:21:35,076 --> 01:21:36,076
Wait!

1330
01:21:36,376 --> 01:21:38,455
You thought about my father!

1331
01:21:39,162 --> 01:21:39,967
-I...
-Why

1332
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:42,191
did you think about my father?

1333
01:21:43,553 --> 01:21:45,267
You s… You saw that?

1334
01:21:45,486 --> 01:21:47,388
Cal… WHY?

1335
01:21:47,662 --> 01:21:48,662
I...

1336
01:21:50,048 --> 01:21:54,912
It is quite unpleasant to be
overwhelmed with someone else's thoughts

1337
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:56,077
but

1338
01:21:56,125 --> 01:22:00,285
it's gets better as soon as
your mind begins to take it all in.

1339
01:22:00,453 --> 01:22:04,741
It felt the same way it did when
you touched me for the first time.

1340
01:22:04,925 --> 01:22:06,805
But how can this be?

1341
01:22:07,116 --> 01:22:11,532
Cal has touched you countless times
and there never was a connection!

1342
01:22:11,817 --> 01:22:14,550
Uh... A connection? Is that how it feels?

1343
01:22:16,261 --> 01:22:19,139
I think it's you, Florence.

1344
01:22:20,768 --> 01:22:21,768
You mean…

1345
01:22:22,425 --> 01:22:24,299
if I touch you…

1346
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:28,669
and someone touches me…

1347
01:22:29,364 --> 01:22:30,515
Let's do it again!

1348
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,540
No!

1349
01:22:34,948 --> 01:22:38,660
Talking to me has always
been one of his greatest desires.

1350
01:22:39,213 --> 01:22:41,567
We should let him. I think so.

1351
01:22:42,088 --> 01:22:43,021
No!

1352
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:46,231
It felt like a steam train
running right through my head!

1353
01:22:48,277 --> 01:22:50,587
His mind is a mess right now.

1354
01:22:51,024 --> 01:22:54,520
If he could somehow
manage to calm himself down

1355
01:22:54,743 --> 01:22:56,791
it won't nearly be so bad.

1356
01:22:56,934 --> 01:22:59,137
Pretty pretty please?

1357
01:23:03,047 --> 01:23:04,338
All right.

1358
01:23:04,409 --> 01:23:06,809
But there's something you must know.

1359
01:23:07,203 --> 01:23:11,841
Unlike her, we have not learned
to keep our thoughts to ourselves.

1360
01:23:12,691 --> 01:23:17,648
You might tell us your darkest
secrets, your most intimate desires

1361
01:23:18,025 --> 01:23:20,692
things you never wanted anybody to know.

1362
01:23:21,106 --> 01:23:23,306
Are you ready to pay the price?

1363
01:23:24,193 --> 01:23:26,701
I've never been so ready.

1364
01:23:27,894 --> 01:23:30,839
All right. Close your eyes.

1365
01:23:31,086 --> 01:23:33,723
Clear your thoughts. Relax.

1366
01:23:34,845 --> 01:23:37,461
Now take my hand.

1367
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,154
Hello, Caligula, my savior!

1368
01:23:49,282 --> 01:23:50,962
Hello Ortha.

1369
01:23:51,804 --> 01:23:53,278
I... I love you.

1370
01:23:56,299 --> 01:23:59,515
I know. I can feel it.

1371
01:24:00,037 --> 01:24:00,979
And...

1372
01:24:01,345 --> 01:24:04,027
And I - I have to tell
you something, Florence.

1373
01:24:04,478 --> 01:24:06,988
The death of your father was no accident.

1374
01:24:07,598 --> 01:24:09,278
Welsh had him murdered.

1375
01:24:14,595 --> 01:24:21,023
[applause]

1376
01:24:24,981 --> 01:24:29,589
I can't believe Welsh killed father just
so he could have the company to himself!

1377
01:24:29,762 --> 01:24:31,442
Does he have no heart?

1378
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:34,215
Feelings can be so confusing!

1379
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:36,939
With Welsh, I always knew where I stood.

1380
01:24:37,003 --> 01:24:39,436
He said what he meant
and meant what he said.

1381
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:41,759
Very rational man, I admired that.

1382
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,310
I'm not very emotional myself.

1383
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,444
You're lying to yourself, Cal

1384
01:24:46,734 --> 01:24:48,334
but don't lie to me.

1385
01:24:48,778 --> 01:24:51,173
Right now, you're bursting with emotion

1386
01:24:51,229 --> 01:24:53,162
and you don't hide them well.

1387
01:24:53,716 --> 01:24:54,716
I'm sorry.

1388
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:56,144
No.

1389
01:24:56,169 --> 01:24:57,169
I am sorry.

1390
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:59,575
For what your mother did to you.

1391
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:00,840
And your father.

1392
01:25:00,912 --> 01:25:02,712
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

1393
01:25:02,773 --> 01:25:04,373
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE!

1394
01:25:04,815 --> 01:25:05,815
You did.

1395
01:25:06,037 --> 01:25:07,665
To me. Right now.

1396
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:08,958
I warned you.

1397
01:25:09,263 --> 01:25:12,729
Keeping your thoughts to
yourself takes a lot of restraint.

1398
01:25:12,754 --> 01:25:15,081
W - what else do you know about me?

1399
01:25:15,496 --> 01:25:18,632
That you cried every time
your mother abused you.

1400
01:25:18,738 --> 01:25:21,205
And your father wouldn't believe you.

1401
01:25:21,353 --> 01:25:23,456
He'd threaten you if
you didn't stop crying.

1402
01:25:23,504 --> 01:25:25,768
Yes! 'Stop crying!' he said.

1403
01:25:25,847 --> 01:25:28,181
'Or I'll give you a reason to cry.'

1404
01:25:28,286 --> 01:25:29,319
That's terrible!

1405
01:25:29,344 --> 01:25:31,024
I don't want your pity!

1406
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:32,732
Pain is a good teacher, you know.

1407
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:35,678
And talking doesn't make
anything better, so why bother?

1408
01:25:35,703 --> 01:25:38,036
I didn't want to hurt you, I swear.

1409
01:25:38,552 --> 01:25:41,074
I can't read your
thoughts against your will.

1410
01:25:41,194 --> 01:25:42,194
And...

1411
01:25:42,249 --> 01:25:45,149
no, Florence, he does
not have a crush on me

1412
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:48,312
because I'm a giant
furry surrogate mother.

1413
01:25:48,472 --> 01:25:50,738
Stop thinking that. It's not true.

1414
01:25:50,902 --> 01:25:51,902
Oh...

1415
01:25:51,998 --> 01:25:52,998
Did I?

1416
01:25:53,134 --> 01:25:55,179
You both have a lot to learn.

1417
01:25:55,227 --> 01:25:58,037
Your thoughts are as
loud as screaming children.

1418
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:01,673
This is intimate, so be
gentle with each other.

1419
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:03,223
And don't judge.

1420
01:26:04,173 --> 01:26:07,857
So, how did you end up working for Welsh?

1421
01:26:08,072 --> 01:26:10,526
An ad in the newspaper,
if you can believe it.

1422
01:26:10,955 --> 01:26:13,968
I wanted to leave this mess
of a family as soon as possible.

1423
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:16,730
I applied shortly after
Welsh took over the company

1424
01:26:16,786 --> 01:26:19,767
and they gave me the
grand title of deputy assistant

1425
01:26:19,792 --> 01:26:21,948
to the secretary of Mr. Welsh.

1426
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:25,591
I made coffee, ran errands,
and I never asked questions.

1427
01:26:25,786 --> 01:26:27,275
That must have impressed him.

1428
01:26:27,386 --> 01:26:29,547
And you never felt any remorse?

1429
01:26:29,627 --> 01:26:31,940
I was his assistant, not his hitman!

1430
01:26:32,004 --> 01:26:34,595
Still, you knew everything.

1431
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:38,497
I didn't make those decisions,
I just had to do what I was told!

1432
01:26:38,624 --> 01:26:40,304
It is all alright Cal.

1433
01:26:40,746 --> 01:26:42,613
We all can't change our past

1434
01:26:42,873 --> 01:26:45,396
but we can change our future.

1435
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:47,415
This is awkward.

1436
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:50,377
I used to be pretty
much the opposite of you.

1437
01:26:50,779 --> 01:26:52,770
All heart and no head.

1438
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:56,303
Always wanting to make
everyone around me happy.

1439
01:26:56,425 --> 01:27:00,457
And you can't imagine how
many times that was a stupid idea.

1440
01:27:00,656 --> 01:27:02,815
Don't believe you were all wrong.

1441
01:27:02,957 --> 01:27:04,757
I wish I was more like you.

1442
01:27:05,534 --> 01:27:06,534
Well

1443
01:27:06,916 --> 01:27:08,508
a little bit at least.

1444
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:12,598
And if you want me to be your
giant teddy bear every now and then

1445
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:14,026
I'll be happy to oblige.

1446
01:27:14,051 --> 01:27:15,709
I DID NOT JUST THINK THAT!

1447
01:27:15,764 --> 01:27:17,260
Loud and clear.

1448
01:27:17,285 --> 01:27:18,954
Ah fuck me in a hammock!

1449
01:27:18,979 --> 01:27:22,106
Oh come here, you
poor two-legged creature.

1450
01:27:22,339 --> 01:27:23,779
And what about me?

1451
01:27:23,831 --> 01:27:25,075
And you too.

1452
01:27:25,487 --> 01:27:28,751
Let's call it a night and
share some dreams, shall we?

1453
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:37,348
[applause]

1454
01:27:39,139 --> 01:27:41,313
Hello my little friends!

1455
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:43,923
Isn't it a wonderful day?

1456
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:48,727
Come here, I have a treat for you!

1457
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:55,581
There you go!

1458
01:28:17,511 --> 01:28:18,511
Oops!

1459
01:28:18,658 --> 01:28:20,098
I'm sorry!

1460
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:22,927
Let me just put this over here…

1461
01:28:37,642 --> 01:28:43,575
Your Majesty, Mr. Welsh awaits
the privilege of your company.

1462
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,735
Punctual as ever.

1463
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:46,887
Show him in.

1464
01:28:47,984 --> 01:28:50,517
Your wish is my
command, your majesty.

1465
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:16,707
Mr. Welsh.

1466
01:29:17,354 --> 01:29:18,821
Your Majesty.

1467
01:29:19,539 --> 01:29:20,899
You may approach.

1468
01:29:21,282 --> 01:29:24,213
I do hope you're bringing good news.

1469
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:27,855
Damn butterflies!

1470
01:29:28,568 --> 01:29:30,594
Oh yes, your Majesty.

1471
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:33,767
The banquet manager and I
have put our heads together

1472
01:29:33,815 --> 01:29:37,238
and we've come up with a way to
make the upcoming state ceremony

1473
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:39,833
even more spectacular.

1474
01:29:39,927 --> 01:29:41,107
Indeed?

1475
01:29:41,372 --> 01:29:44,003
Your plans must be sensational

1476
01:29:44,163 --> 01:29:47,957
if you presume to charge even
more to the Royal Treasury.

1477
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:53,081
Nononono, absolutely not, your Majesty.

1478
01:29:53,177 --> 01:29:55,302
Here, please have a look.

1479
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:56,540
Huh!

1480
01:29:58,086 --> 01:29:59,086
Okay...

1481
01:30:00,334 --> 01:30:02,069
So... Hmm...

1482
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:03,557
Hmm... hmm… hmm…

1483
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:05,300
I see…

1484
01:30:05,872 --> 01:30:07,919
an even bigger cake …

1485
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:10,021
if you insist …

1486
01:30:10,983 --> 01:30:13,311
more electric lights …

1487
01:30:13,734 --> 01:30:17,074
a gold plated cage for the beast?

1488
01:30:17,595 --> 01:30:18,595
Really?

1489
01:30:18,772 --> 01:30:21,216
It looks magnificent!

1490
01:30:21,288 --> 01:30:22,968
Everybody will want one!

1491
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:27,469
That may be, but the
budget remains fixed.

1492
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:31,420
The House of Astar
should be well presented

1493
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,704
but we will NOT be
remembered for wasteful excess.

1494
01:30:35,855 --> 01:30:38,201
Do we understand each other?

1495
01:30:38,273 --> 01:30:43,393
Your Majesty will be remembered for
ensuring the safety and prosperity of Astar.

1496
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:48,176
The cage and the animal are my personal
gift for your Majesty's collection.

1497
01:30:48,439 --> 01:30:52,354
All preparations will of course
be done at my own expense.

1498
01:30:52,423 --> 01:30:56,538
In our experience, nothing
costs more than a gift.

1499
01:30:57,182 --> 01:31:02,721
Presumably there's a price that
you didn't write on this piece of paper?

1500
01:31:03,036 --> 01:31:06,982
Well … we have to make
few small adjustments

1501
01:31:07,007 --> 01:31:08,522
to the list of suppliers

1502
01:31:08,586 --> 01:31:11,599
and a slight change in the schedule

1503
01:31:11,782 --> 01:31:12,902
but that's it.

1504
01:31:13,753 --> 01:31:15,324
Such as?

1505
01:31:15,716 --> 01:31:18,148
I have talked to Eva Harrington

1506
01:31:18,204 --> 01:31:23,454
and I'm afraid supplying a cake of
these dimensions are beyond her capacity.

1507
01:31:23,881 --> 01:31:27,916
So that commission would have to go to
Cantrell's Bakery in Chultberg instead.

1508
01:31:28,482 --> 01:31:33,377
And the gold plating on the cage
will take three extra days to finish

1509
01:31:33,797 --> 01:31:37,011
so it would be great if we could postpone …

1510
01:31:37,036 --> 01:31:38,036
No!

1511
01:31:39,589 --> 01:31:41,879
I'm sorry, your Majesty?

1512
01:31:42,342 --> 01:31:45,340
Apology accepted, Mister Welsh.

1513
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:48,896
We're pleased you regret
bothering the butterflies

1514
01:31:48,976 --> 01:31:51,043
with such disagreeable demands.

1515
01:31:51,078 --> 01:31:54,689
Your Majesty. I don't think I understand.

1516
01:31:54,824 --> 01:31:59,184
As you know, Mister Welsh,
you serve the House of Astar

1517
01:31:59,328 --> 01:32:03,606
and the Royal Court is not
one of your carnival attractions.

1518
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:06,399
You must be so embarrassed

1519
01:32:06,424 --> 01:32:10,142
for thinking you could dictate
the terms of our arrangement.

1520
01:32:10,571 --> 01:32:12,830
I assure your Majesty

1521
01:32:12,855 --> 01:32:17,112
that all my intentions are only
in the Crown's best interest!

1522
01:32:17,923 --> 01:32:20,027
Of course, Mister Welsh

1523
01:32:20,276 --> 01:32:22,843
and your service is appreciated.

1524
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,676
Such as your impeccable consultations

1525
01:32:25,803 --> 01:32:28,848
of the imminent uprising in Vanos.

1526
01:32:28,983 --> 01:32:30,217
Do you remember?

1527
01:32:30,273 --> 01:32:32,394
The one that never happened?

1528
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:34,740
Oh your highness

1529
01:32:34,772 --> 01:32:36,582
we've been through this before.

1530
01:32:36,662 --> 01:32:41,855
I swear by my life, I never
withheld any information from you!

1531
01:32:42,782 --> 01:32:45,385
Vanos was a peaceful country

1532
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,628
its borders undisputed for centuries.

1533
01:32:48,803 --> 01:32:51,704
We marched in like invaders!

1534
01:32:52,068 --> 01:32:56,276
Tens of thousands of innocent
civilians paid with their lives.

1535
01:32:56,332 --> 01:32:59,908
And the Kingdom of
Astar has been re-united

1536
01:32:59,972 --> 01:33:02,301
something that nobody had thought possible.

1537
01:33:02,428 --> 01:33:06,266
And all thanks to you, my Queen

1538
01:33:06,408 --> 01:33:08,646
and your wise decision.

1539
01:33:08,824 --> 01:33:10,790
That is the official version.

1540
01:33:11,525 --> 01:33:14,597
And the version that we
both come off best with.

1541
01:33:15,126 --> 01:33:17,395
And that is the only reason

1542
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:20,925
you're not dangling from
the oak tree on timber hill yet.

1543
01:33:21,534 --> 01:33:23,140
You're a cunning man

1544
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:26,879
and in these troubled times,
we value your connections.

1545
01:33:27,065 --> 01:33:29,932
And you are very useful to the royal court.

1546
01:33:30,366 --> 01:33:35,002
But don't treat your
Queen like a fool ever again.

1547
01:33:35,701 --> 01:33:40,329
The war on Vanos was one of the
biggest profit you ever made.

1548
01:33:40,794 --> 01:33:46,063
Your own little empire only
exists because we allow it.

1549
01:33:47,737 --> 01:33:52,839
And I am eternally grateful for
your generosity, your Highness.

1550
01:33:53,247 --> 01:33:55,675
The Kingdom of Astar prospers.

1551
01:33:56,079 --> 01:33:57,359
Our cities grow.

1552
01:33:58,089 --> 01:34:00,956
At some point, our island will be too small

1553
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:04,510
and colonization will become inevitable.

1554
01:34:05,034 --> 01:34:07,654
Our interests are well aligned with yours

1555
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:08,710
right now.

1556
01:34:08,799 --> 01:34:12,682
But in the great equation
of our country's history

1557
01:34:13,073 --> 01:34:15,035
the Crown is the constant.

1558
01:34:15,162 --> 01:34:18,713
And you are merely a variable.

1559
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:24,216
Of course, your Highness.

1560
01:34:24,391 --> 01:34:27,178
The date of the state ceremony stands.

1561
01:34:27,425 --> 01:34:32,417
And we will not break our long and
excellent relationship with the Harringtons

1562
01:34:32,599 --> 01:34:34,799
over a few more levels on a cake.

1563
01:34:35,301 --> 01:34:40,910
We appreciate that you so graciously
agree to the wisdom of these decisions.

1564
01:34:47,047 --> 01:34:50,009
Thank you for the paper, Mister Welsh.

1565
01:34:50,478 --> 01:34:54,214
We're certain the moths
will gladly accept your gift.

1566
01:35:02,316 --> 01:35:03,316
Uhg!

1567
01:35:09,347 --> 01:35:13,731
If Mr. Welsh please would
follow me to the door.

1568
01:35:15,414 --> 01:35:17,837
Would it be possible to use the … um …

1569
01:35:17,862 --> 01:35:19,729
mobile phone before I leave?

1570
01:35:19,795 --> 01:35:23,643
I have a few business arrangements
to make for the state ceremony.

1571
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,739
Certainly. Please wait here.

1572
01:35:47,594 --> 01:35:48,594
Heavens!

1573
01:35:48,946 --> 01:35:50,209
Pardon me, sir

1574
01:35:54,561 --> 01:35:56,894
there was something
funny with the cable, sir.

1575
01:35:59,689 --> 01:36:00,689
Thank you.

1576
01:36:00,705 --> 01:36:03,111
Now, if I could have some privacy please.

1577
01:36:03,136 --> 01:36:06,040
Important royal business matters.

1578
01:36:06,065 --> 01:36:07,670
Of course, sir.

1579
01:36:20,895 --> 01:36:22,429
Hello? Operator?

1580
01:36:22,773 --> 01:36:25,862
Please give me number 4441.

1581
01:36:26,029 --> 01:36:27,029
Thank you.

1582
01:36:29,931 --> 01:36:32,724
Hi there, it's me, Welsh.

1583
01:36:32,867 --> 01:36:34,568
I'm using the Phone in the Palace

1584
01:36:34,593 --> 01:36:37,077
so I'm pretty sure nobody is listening.

1585
01:36:37,475 --> 01:36:40,800
They are not going to
postpone the reception.

1586
01:36:41,293 --> 01:36:44,801
That means you have
three days to get Ortha back.

1587
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:46,792
Ortha.

1588
01:36:47,505 --> 01:36:48,505
The beast.

1589
01:36:49,636 --> 01:36:50,636
Yes.

1590
01:36:51,303 --> 01:36:52,626
I know!

1591
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:54,971
I don't care how.

1592
01:36:54,996 --> 01:36:56,474
It has to work!

1593
01:36:57,401 --> 01:36:59,912
We got away with the whole Vanos affair

1594
01:36:59,976 --> 01:37:01,909
but if we want to do it again

1595
01:37:01,995 --> 01:37:06,364
I need the Queen to trust
me, no questions asked.

1596
01:37:06,888 --> 01:37:09,832
We'll be safe once past
the point of no return

1597
01:37:10,078 --> 01:37:12,212
but that's a long way off.

1598
01:37:13,087 --> 01:37:14,330
Call the think tank.

1599
01:37:14,410 --> 01:37:17,915
Let them do their thing,
propaganda, bribes

1600
01:37:17,946 --> 01:37:19,946
let them stage something!

1601
01:37:20,453 --> 01:37:24,313
as long as the Queen thinks
we saved her royal hide.

1602
01:37:26,379 --> 01:37:29,360
No, that's not all.

1603
01:37:29,638 --> 01:37:31,234
About the Harringtons.

1604
01:37:31,275 --> 01:37:33,062
Florence is dead

1605
01:37:33,087 --> 01:37:37,658
and that means Eva Harrington
needs to be terminated, ASAP

1606
01:37:39,236 --> 01:37:40,236
What?!

1607
01:37:40,989 --> 01:37:42,669
Florence is still alive?

1608
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,160
And Cal too?

1609
01:37:45,367 --> 01:37:46,567
Where are they?

1610
01:37:46,829 --> 01:37:49,229
Why don't you tell me that earlier?

1611
01:37:50,134 --> 01:37:54,141
I KNOW I TALK A LOT, THAT'S
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT TO SAY!

1612
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:59,270
So what are you waiting for, kill them!

1613
01:38:00,199 --> 01:38:02,534
Yes, all of them, including Eva!

1614
01:38:02,764 --> 01:38:04,889
Because otherwise they'll spill the beans

1615
01:38:04,914 --> 01:38:07,221
that's why YOU MORON!

1616
01:38:07,307 --> 01:38:08,307
ARRGH!

1617
01:38:19,915 --> 01:38:26,398
[applause]

1618
01:38:28,939 --> 01:38:29,939
Ortha?

1619
01:38:30,189 --> 01:38:31,061
Yes?

1620
01:38:31,085 --> 01:38:34,360
What exactly does "Guardian
of the Realm" mean?

1621
01:38:34,637 --> 01:38:37,370
It's not nearly as exciting as it sounds.

1622
01:38:37,987 --> 01:38:42,358
It's my duty to fly along the
border and report anything unusual.

1623
01:38:42,496 --> 01:38:45,213
From bad weather to unexpected guests.

1624
01:38:45,459 --> 01:38:47,859
Oh, so there is more than one realm?

1625
01:38:48,056 --> 01:38:49,176
Five, in fact.

1626
01:38:49,612 --> 01:38:52,675
Dumarth, Onedoth, Klam

1627
01:38:52,913 --> 01:38:55,563
Serotho and the desert in the south

1628
01:38:55,738 --> 01:38:57,025
nobody lives there.

1629
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:59,581
Does the continent have a name, too?

1630
01:38:59,732 --> 01:39:01,312
We just call it 'home'.

1631
01:39:01,344 --> 01:39:03,024
And that's also its name.

1632
01:39:03,497 --> 01:39:04,873
How do your people live?

1633
01:39:04,898 --> 01:39:05,759
I mean …

1634
01:39:05,784 --> 01:39:07,808
do you have houses? Streets?

1635
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,723
Do you know numbers and letters?

1636
01:39:09,748 --> 01:39:11,428
Of course we have houses.

1637
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:13,246
And proper ones, of course.

1638
01:39:13,271 --> 01:39:14,951
Not as tiny as yours!

1639
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,958
We also have streets, but
only for moving heavy goods.

1640
01:39:19,014 --> 01:39:20,948
Why walk when you have wings?

1641
01:39:21,335 --> 01:39:24,266
The best houses are at
the cliffside of the mountains

1642
01:39:24,314 --> 01:39:26,193
and there's no path leading there.

1643
01:39:26,234 --> 01:39:27,514
You have to fly.

1644
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,413
But nobody sees that as an inconvenience.

1645
01:39:30,542 --> 01:39:33,737
We're much more versatile
in the air than we are on foot.

1646
01:39:34,054 --> 01:39:36,143
And yes, we know numbers

1647
01:39:36,302 --> 01:39:38,658
not that I'm very good with them, though.

1648
01:39:38,737 --> 01:39:40,244
And your diet?

1649
01:39:40,553 --> 01:39:42,953
Do you only eat fish and fresh meat?

1650
01:39:43,431 --> 01:39:46,743
We cook, we have many
ways to preserve food.

1651
01:39:47,069 --> 01:39:49,600
How else are we supposed to eat in winter?

1652
01:39:49,752 --> 01:39:51,926
I prefer fresh meat, though.

1653
01:39:52,276 --> 01:39:55,176
So if you're hungry,
you have to go hunting?

1654
01:39:55,255 --> 01:39:57,807
If I have the time,
and friends to go with …

1655
01:39:57,959 --> 01:40:00,482
we hunt more for fun
than for anything else.

1656
01:40:00,586 --> 01:40:04,351
It's a lot more convenient to just
buy your food at the town market.

1657
01:40:04,574 --> 01:40:06,974
Also, the quality is so much better!

1658
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:09,650
How do you talk to each other?

1659
01:40:09,794 --> 01:40:12,414
I mean, do you always have to hold hands?

1660
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:14,706
And what if you want some privacy?

1661
01:40:15,246 --> 01:40:17,325
Our minds are our voices.

1662
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:19,275
We don't need to touch

1663
01:40:19,409 --> 01:40:22,417
if we want to be heard
far away, we think loudly

1664
01:40:22,888 --> 01:40:25,312
and when we want to
keep something to ourselves

1665
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:26,720
we think quietly.

1666
01:40:26,831 --> 01:40:28,416
Unlike you two.

1667
01:40:28,654 --> 01:40:30,454
This sounds so fascinating!

1668
01:40:30,673 --> 01:40:31,953
And the images …

1669
01:40:32,289 --> 01:40:34,734
I wish I could visit your realm one day.

1670
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:37,497
It's like nothing I've ever seen before!

1671
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:39,580
It's a beautiful place.

1672
01:40:39,886 --> 01:40:41,953
But don't let that deceive you.

1673
01:40:42,362 --> 01:40:45,162
We have our share of trouble and politics.

1674
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:48,891
In that regard, we're not that
much different than you two-leggers.

1675
01:40:48,947 --> 01:40:51,770
Can you lie to each other?

1676
01:40:51,858 --> 01:40:53,458
Are there criminals?

1677
01:40:53,578 --> 01:40:57,418
Why am I not surprised you
are the one to ask that question?

1678
01:40:57,795 --> 01:41:02,573
We can lie, which makes justice
as difficult for us as it is to you.

1679
01:41:02,883 --> 01:41:05,005
When someone is accused of a crime

1680
01:41:05,077 --> 01:41:07,400
they're brought to the
trial before the elders

1681
01:41:07,425 --> 01:41:09,158
and can defend themselves.

1682
01:41:09,344 --> 01:41:11,975
Only in extreme cases can they be forced

1683
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,069
to expose their most private thoughts
and memories to the court of the elders.

1684
01:41:16,245 --> 01:41:19,057
I thought you can't read
someone's mind against their will?

1685
01:41:19,082 --> 01:41:22,209
Nor can I speak to someone's
mind against their will.

1686
01:41:22,369 --> 01:41:25,573
But the elders can, when
joining their minds together.

1687
01:41:25,954 --> 01:41:28,765
It's a brutal and painful procedure

1688
01:41:29,057 --> 01:41:31,324
especially if the subject resists.

1689
01:41:31,549 --> 01:41:33,989
Some have even lost their minds.

1690
01:41:34,117 --> 01:41:35,117
It's very scary.

1691
01:41:35,724 --> 01:41:38,161
There's a huge political debate going on

1692
01:41:38,185 --> 01:41:40,985
whether this procedure is a necessary evil

1693
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:43,606
or if it should be
outlawed once and for all.

1694
01:41:43,677 --> 01:41:47,165
I don't even want to know
what they could do to our minds …

1695
01:41:47,205 --> 01:41:49,988
Your thoughts are so frail and brittle.

1696
01:41:50,076 --> 01:41:52,943
Talking to you is like walking on thin ice.

1697
01:41:53,644 --> 01:41:54,844
But I like you.

1698
01:41:55,031 --> 01:41:56,711
I could never harm you.

1699
01:41:57,134 --> 01:42:00,178
Besides, we are not a violent people.

1700
01:42:00,799 --> 01:42:02,866
If we cause pain to one another

1701
01:42:02,984 --> 01:42:05,318
we can feel it like it was our own.

1702
01:42:05,409 --> 01:42:07,089
If that doesn't stop you

1703
01:42:07,406 --> 01:42:08,950
you have a heart of stone!

1704
01:42:09,032 --> 01:42:10,157
Like Welsh.

1705
01:42:10,241 --> 01:42:12,971
You can't imagine how much I wish I could

1706
01:42:12,996 --> 01:42:15,129
make him feel the pain he caused.

1707
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:17,218
That would teach him a lesson.

1708
01:42:17,329 --> 01:42:21,302
I'm afraid we'll have to find another
way to make him pay for his crimes.

1709
01:42:21,342 --> 01:42:24,036
And you know a lot more
about those than I do!

1710
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:28,101
Yeah, we're not going to run out of
things to talk about anytime soon …

1711
01:42:28,189 --> 01:42:30,391
Someone needs to write a book about this!

1712
01:42:30,424 --> 01:42:32,424
I didn't know you could write!

1713
01:42:32,573 --> 01:42:33,938
Oh shut up, woman.

1714
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,521
thbbbbbbt!

1715
01:42:47,883 --> 01:42:50,796
[applause]

1716
01:42:50,999 --> 01:42:51,999
Yeaaaaaah!

1717
01:42:56,562 --> 01:42:59,252
We are the dragon riders of Vanos!

1718
01:42:59,277 --> 01:43:02,125
And we are going to avenge
our brothers and sisters!

1719
01:43:02,213 --> 01:43:04,444
Why do I always have to sit in the back!

1720
01:43:04,476 --> 01:43:05,564
Because you're stupid!

1721
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:06,580
No I'm not!

1722
01:43:06,642 --> 01:43:07,773
Yes you are!

1723
01:43:07,798 --> 01:43:10,025
You don't even know how to ride a dragon!

1724
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,665
Oh yes I do!

1725
01:43:11,690 --> 01:43:12,781
No you don't!

1726
01:43:12,845 --> 01:43:14,724
Just wait, I'll show ya!

1727
01:43:14,834 --> 01:43:16,466
Rarrrgh!

1728
01:43:23,204 --> 01:43:25,513
Hey! Hey, be gentle!

1729
01:43:25,719 --> 01:43:27,614
Ortha's not a toy!

1730
01:43:29,807 --> 01:43:30,531
Mommy!

1731
01:43:30,555 --> 01:43:31,555
It's enough!

1732
01:43:31,761 --> 01:43:33,677
Out with you, all three.

1733
01:43:33,821 --> 01:43:35,330
Out out out!

1734
01:43:35,714 --> 01:43:37,394
Go play on the beach!

1735
01:43:38,817 --> 01:43:40,097
Can we keep her?

1736
01:43:40,295 --> 01:43:42,157
She's so fluffy!

1737
01:43:43,145 --> 01:43:44,185
No, we can't.

1738
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:47,190
She's not a pet, you know?

1739
01:43:47,494 --> 01:43:49,137
Oh man …

1740
01:43:55,223 --> 01:43:57,095
Goodbye, Mrs. Ortha!

1741
01:44:01,626 --> 01:44:06,647
Ah, it's so nice to have
children in the house again …

1742
01:44:06,941 --> 01:44:10,375
but sometimes silence IS golden.

1743
01:44:10,748 --> 01:44:12,548
Ortha says they're adorable

1744
01:44:13,211 --> 01:44:15,836
and you should be glad
they don't grow wings.

1745
01:44:17,518 --> 01:44:19,328
Oh my god, yes!

1746
01:44:20,134 --> 01:44:21,966
Are they all yours?

1747
01:44:21,991 --> 01:44:23,878
Oh no, no, no.

1748
01:44:24,158 --> 01:44:25,958
They're orphans of the war.

1749
01:44:26,422 --> 01:44:28,942
Will is teaching them how to read and write

1750
01:44:29,014 --> 01:44:30,694
and be good farmhands.

1751
01:44:30,917 --> 01:44:33,817
My own son moved out ages ago.

1752
01:44:34,227 --> 01:44:35,675
And what about you?

1753
01:44:36,098 --> 01:44:38,431
Are you still living with your mom?

1754
01:44:38,809 --> 01:44:41,528
Yes. And she's
probably dying of sorrow

1755
01:44:41,553 --> 01:44:43,233
not knowing where I am.

1756
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:45,330
Do you have a telephone?

1757
01:44:45,517 --> 01:44:46,717
I'm afraid not.

1758
01:44:47,516 --> 01:44:52,206
Next one is at the post office in
St. Eliza, about 15 miles away.

1759
01:44:53,381 --> 01:44:54,381
Damn.

1760
01:44:54,463 --> 01:44:57,096
Then we need to find
someone to take us there.

1761
01:44:57,144 --> 01:44:58,144
Huh...

1762
01:44:59,098 --> 01:45:01,348
Do you think the people here will help us?

1763
01:45:01,412 --> 01:45:02,932
Oh, why shouldn't they?

1764
01:45:03,763 --> 01:45:09,511
Because for them I'm probably the most
Anti-Vanosian guy save for Welsh himself?

1765
01:45:10,481 --> 01:45:12,544
*sigh* Oh rubbish.

1766
01:45:13,101 --> 01:45:14,835
It don' matter who you are

1767
01:45:14,998 --> 01:45:16,678
it matters what ya' do!

1768
01:45:17,372 --> 01:45:19,052
They may be patriotic

1769
01:45:19,077 --> 01:45:20,757
but they're not stupid.

1770
01:45:21,421 --> 01:45:26,189
When they see Ortha, they
have no reason to doubt you.

1771
01:45:29,396 --> 01:45:30,997
I'm back, honey!

1772
01:45:31,624 --> 01:45:32,624
Oh!

1773
01:45:32,853 --> 01:45:35,586
Hello everybody!
Come in and have a seat!

1774
01:45:54,502 --> 01:45:55,502
Awrite!

1775
01:45:59,002 --> 01:46:02,394
Sorry for dragging you
in like this by your tails.

1776
01:46:02,958 --> 01:46:05,389
Let me make y'all
aquaintances to my guests

1777
01:46:05,742 --> 01:46:08,255
This here is Florence Harrington

1778
01:46:08,620 --> 01:46:10,887
she is the gilr of Peter Harringtonn.

1779
01:46:10,964 --> 01:46:14,157
And that next sir here is Caligula Davis

1780
01:46:14,331 --> 01:46:17,165
he was former assistant
of that Welsh fella.

1781
01:46:17,583 --> 01:46:19,470
And that's miss Ortha

1782
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:23,275
neither beast nor a dragon,
no matter what she may look like.

1783
01:46:24,974 --> 01:46:27,795
Then what in the land's name is she?

1784
01:46:28,078 --> 01:46:30,324
She is a person.

1785
01:46:30,624 --> 01:46:33,153
Her people have a highly developed culture

1786
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:35,921
but they communicate with their minds only.

1787
01:46:36,025 --> 01:46:38,923
For some reason she can only speak to me.

1788
01:46:39,269 --> 01:46:41,469
Well, and those who I can touch.

1789
01:46:43,412 --> 01:46:48,968
Uh, I wonder how much effort it's
taking them to not stare at me.

1790
01:46:49,015 --> 01:46:50,543
Oh shush!

1791
01:46:51,318 --> 01:46:54,582
That sounds pretty fantastic.

1792
01:46:54,932 --> 01:46:57,508
How do we know you're
not making it all up?

1793
01:47:07,215 --> 01:47:08,215
Uhmmmm…

1794
01:47:24,228 --> 01:47:26,910
Thank you, I guess...

1795
01:47:30,102 --> 01:47:34,602
Anyway, I accidentally
discovered that Ortha is telepathic.

1796
01:47:34,975 --> 01:47:36,655
She begged me to help her

1797
01:47:36,788 --> 01:47:38,965
and that's how I ended
up in Welsh's airship

1798
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:42,063
when it took off after the
bomb attacks in Port Ospen.

1799
01:47:42,389 --> 01:47:44,523
I was Ortha's guard at the time.

1800
01:47:44,615 --> 01:47:48,414
Don't ask me how, but Florence
managed to convince me to switch sides

1801
01:47:48,439 --> 01:47:49,959
and set Ortha free.

1802
01:47:50,777 --> 01:47:54,444
We tried to flee from Welsh's
airship in one of his fighter planes

1803
01:47:54,469 --> 01:47:56,149
but his men shot us down.

1804
01:47:56,711 --> 01:47:59,522
Only thanks to Ortha's
help we managed to survive.

1805
01:47:59,747 --> 01:48:02,614
Their plane crashed right into my backyard!

1806
01:48:06,361 --> 01:48:09,317
Well, since you're
obviously holding up so well

1807
01:48:09,342 --> 01:48:12,606
why don't you go back to
Astar where you came from?

1808
01:48:12,931 --> 01:48:14,864
Because Welsh wants us dead.

1809
01:48:15,306 --> 01:48:18,622
That's almost as bad as the
Queen herself wanting us dead.

1810
01:48:18,718 --> 01:48:21,557
Astar is no longer a
place for us to go home to.

1811
01:48:21,693 --> 01:48:23,782
Now isn't that ironic?

1812
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:26,113
Certainly not for Ortha.

1813
01:48:26,209 --> 01:48:29,407
She's stranded thousands
of miles away from home

1814
01:48:29,463 --> 01:48:31,796
in a world she does not understand.

1815
01:48:32,419 --> 01:48:35,315
Vanos versus Astar means nothing to her.

1816
01:48:36,085 --> 01:48:38,613
I still don't trust ye.

1817
01:48:40,106 --> 01:48:44,169
Did you know the Queen never
wanted war against Vanos?

1818
01:48:44,505 --> 01:48:46,185
Welsh conned her into it.

1819
01:48:46,444 --> 01:48:47,444
What?!

1820
01:48:48,313 --> 01:48:50,779
I knew this would get you interested.

1821
01:48:51,592 --> 01:48:55,880
Father's early planes were designed
for entirely peaceful purposes.

1822
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:59,037
Welsh, however, figured
they would earn a lot more

1823
01:48:59,062 --> 01:49:01,694
by selling them as instruments of war.

1824
01:49:01,779 --> 01:49:05,576
When father refused, Welsh
sabotaged his plane, and

1825
01:49:06,263 --> 01:49:07,263
he died.

1826
01:49:08,473 --> 01:49:12,301
Welsh then forced my mother to
sell him father's half of the company.

1827
01:49:12,492 --> 01:49:14,992
He threatened to kill me if she refused

1828
01:49:15,054 --> 01:49:17,187
or the truth ever came to light.

1829
01:49:17,912 --> 01:49:20,712
And now, what sells
weapons better than a war?

1830
01:49:21,296 --> 01:49:25,648
Welsh spread rumors about a huge
secret armament happening in Vanos.

1831
01:49:25,713 --> 01:49:29,405
Bombs exploded at strategic
places in Astarian cities.

1832
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:34,117
And soon everybody was in
fear over the threat from Vanos.

1833
01:49:34,235 --> 01:49:35,885
A threat well fabricated enough

1834
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:39,198
to convince the Queen
she needs a royal air force.

1835
01:49:39,364 --> 01:49:43,410
And that's how Welsh became
the richest man in the world.

1836
01:49:43,435 --> 01:49:47,567
If that were true, history
would have to be rewritten!

1837
01:49:48,096 --> 01:49:52,512
After the war, Welsh needed new
threats to keep his business running.

1838
01:49:53,211 --> 01:49:55,705
Ortha's kin is that new threat.

1839
01:49:56,069 --> 01:49:58,583
That's why they didn't
kill her like the others

1840
01:49:58,608 --> 01:50:01,508
but brought her back
as a gift to the Queen.

1841
01:50:01,892 --> 01:50:04,425
They didn't expect her to be sentient.

1842
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:07,956
And it occurred to no one that
they had just slaughtered an entire …

1843
01:50:07,981 --> 01:50:12,096
ARGH! ORTHA! PLEASE!

1844
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:14,732
What?

1845
01:50:16,142 --> 01:50:17,782
I'm sorry …

1846
01:50:18,187 --> 01:50:19,608
I'm so sorry.

1847
01:50:19,633 --> 01:50:23,276
I … I'm trying... I'm doing my best to

1848
01:50:23,363 --> 01:50:25,642
to keep my feelings to myself, but

1849
01:50:25,928 --> 01:50:27,608
the horrors of that day...

1850
01:50:27,947 --> 01:50:29,627
I couldn't hold it back!

1851
01:50:29,733 --> 01:50:31,752
It's alright, Ortha!
We're here for you...

1852
01:50:31,904 --> 01:50:34,237
let's... Let's think about something else...

1853
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:35,961
W... what...

1854
01:50:36,222 --> 01:50:38,410
just... happened?

1855
01:50:40,066 --> 01:50:43,903
Ortha was just overwhelmed
by the memories of her brother

1856
01:50:43,959 --> 01:50:46,598
dying before her in a hailstorm of bullets

1857
01:50:46,654 --> 01:50:50,419
and she inadvertently
shared it with me.

1858
01:50:51,248 --> 01:50:55,370
For a moment it was like
I had been there myself.

1859
01:50:55,487 --> 01:50:58,067
The world needs to know about this!

1860
01:50:58,707 --> 01:50:59,947
And then what?

1861
01:51:00,256 --> 01:51:04,151
You think they're be all 'well,
oh pardon me folks, my bad', and

1862
01:51:04,191 --> 01:51:05,675
give us our land back?

1863
01:51:05,774 --> 01:51:09,998
No, but the blood of our friends
and families is on Welsh's hands.

1864
01:51:10,527 --> 01:51:14,346
If there's a way to make
him burn in hell for his sins

1865
01:51:14,836 --> 01:51:16,918
I'll be first in line.

1866
01:51:17,053 --> 01:51:20,429
Us against the most
powerful man in the world?

1867
01:51:20,898 --> 01:51:22,574
That's... That's hopeless!

1868
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:27,119
Ooh, powers can be taken away
just as easily as they were granted.

1869
01:51:27,172 --> 01:51:29,401
Yeah, but who could do that

1870
01:51:29,489 --> 01:51:32,121
except maybe the Queen herself?

1871
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:34,067
Exactly!

1872
01:51:34,755 --> 01:51:37,137
-Are you crazy?
-No!

1873
01:51:37,446 --> 01:51:40,814
Do you see how Ortha's
memories affected Florence

1874
01:51:40,839 --> 01:51:43,039
when she remembered the massacre?

1875
01:51:43,555 --> 01:51:46,887
If we can give Queen Irdis the
same profound first hand experience

1876
01:51:46,912 --> 01:51:48,779
of Ortha's horrible memories

1877
01:51:48,804 --> 01:51:51,812
she is not going to
question what she will see.

1878
01:51:54,114 --> 01:51:57,374
Intruding someone's mind against their will

1879
01:51:58,222 --> 01:52:00,963
it's - it's a big taboo among my people!

1880
01:52:01,901 --> 01:52:04,304
It can even make them go mad!

1881
01:52:05,169 --> 01:52:07,147
But he's right, isn't he?

1882
01:52:08,482 --> 01:52:09,482
Probably.

1883
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:11,181
Look.

1884
01:52:11,281 --> 01:52:14,407
Tonight will be the first
new moon of summer.

1885
01:52:14,605 --> 01:52:17,406
Like every year, the
Queen is going to visit

1886
01:52:17,431 --> 01:52:21,282
the shrine of the forefathers at
the south end of the palace garden

1887
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:27,202
lay down a single white rose and
pray for the goodwill of their spirits.

1888
01:52:27,448 --> 01:52:31,673
It's going to be dark, and
she is going to be all alone.

1889
01:52:32,082 --> 01:52:35,939
Nobody is going to expect
anybody coming from the air.

1890
01:52:37,619 --> 01:52:42,040
So he wants me to swoop
down on her and carry her away?

1891
01:52:42,736 --> 01:52:44,256
It's not that easy!

1892
01:52:44,628 --> 01:52:46,362
I don't want to hurt her!

1893
01:52:46,689 --> 01:52:49,589
If the slightest thing
goes wrong, we're dead

1894
01:52:49,893 --> 01:52:54,448
and even if I manage to bring
her here and share my memories...

1895
01:52:54,624 --> 01:52:57,861
we have no idea how she's going to react!

1896
01:52:57,961 --> 01:53:01,684
Yeah. Yeah, it's crazy to bet
everything on one card like that!

1897
01:53:01,756 --> 01:53:04,407
Does anybody have a better idea?

1898
01:53:05,110 --> 01:53:06,230
*sigh* Listen.

1899
01:53:06,762 --> 01:53:10,396
If we don't act now, you will soon be dead

1900
01:53:10,493 --> 01:53:14,352
and Ortha ends up as an exhibit
in the Queen's zoological garden.

1901
01:53:14,516 --> 01:53:17,402
Welsh is out to get you as we speak.

1902
01:53:18,147 --> 01:53:19,147
Ortha?

1903
01:53:21,574 --> 01:53:24,177
Technically, I could do it.

1904
01:53:24,419 --> 01:53:27,152
It's against my innermost beliefs though.

1905
01:53:27,759 --> 01:53:29,559
It just doesn't feel right.

1906
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:33,157
But I also feel how desperate you are.

1907
01:53:33,182 --> 01:53:36,105
And I - I don't have a better plan either.

1908
01:53:36,831 --> 01:53:38,565
Do you think it will work?

1909
01:53:38,704 --> 01:53:39,704
It could.

1910
01:53:41,185 --> 01:53:44,020
Then I'll trust you. I will do it.

1911
01:53:45,436 --> 01:53:47,806
I can drive you all to Port Ospen.

1912
01:53:47,926 --> 01:53:49,659
My truck fits two horses...

1913
01:53:50,501 --> 01:53:51,541
or one Ortha.

1914
01:53:53,805 --> 01:53:57,377
Oh, can someone please
bring the children back in?

1915
01:53:57,489 --> 01:54:00,022
At least they thought I was a dragon...

1916
01:54:01,141 --> 01:54:02,730
I'll be coming with you.

1917
01:54:02,755 --> 01:54:04,422
And me too.

1918
01:54:05,717 --> 01:54:08,451
Meet me tonight at nine, behind my house.

1919
01:54:15,536 --> 01:54:22,185
[applause]

1920
01:54:45,895 --> 01:54:47,575
Good evening everyone!

1921
01:54:47,806 --> 01:54:49,326
Are we ready to go?

1922
01:54:52,353 --> 01:54:56,769
I'd like to go through the steps
again one more time before we start.

1923
01:54:58,433 --> 01:55:00,853
Yes, that's a good idea.

1924
01:55:01,228 --> 01:55:04,128
I don't have a very
good feeling about this.

1925
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:07,213
Alright. So here's the plan.

1926
01:55:07,419 --> 01:55:09,553
Correct me if I'm wrong, Illyan.

1927
01:55:10,021 --> 01:55:13,223
Florence, Cal and Ortha
get on the back of the truck

1928
01:55:13,247 --> 01:55:15,380
and Illyan drives them all into the city.

1929
01:55:17,955 --> 01:55:18,955
Check.

1930
01:55:19,722 --> 01:55:23,562
Illyan then stops at the north end
of the park, behind the hedge.

1931
01:55:24,493 --> 01:55:25,493
Check.

1932
01:55:25,735 --> 01:55:27,668
Then right before midnight

1933
01:55:27,711 --> 01:55:30,471
miss Ortha flies northeast,
over the palace wall

1934
01:55:30,557 --> 01:55:33,933
and does some circles till that she
can spot the Queen down in the garden.

1935
01:55:34,053 --> 01:55:35,594
Yes, correct.

1936
01:55:36,231 --> 01:55:39,657
Miss Ortha goes down, grabs
the Queen, and gets her to car

1937
01:55:39,801 --> 01:55:41,853
Cal and Florence
are going to watch her then

1938
01:55:41,937 --> 01:55:44,019
and Illyan drives everyone back.

1939
01:55:44,217 --> 01:55:45,217
Yup.

1940
01:55:46,508 --> 01:55:50,959
I reckon we got about an hour or two
before anyone will notice the Queen's gone.

1941
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:54,785
Which means that if we don't
manage to bring her back until then

1942
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:56,943
we're fucked six ways to Sunday.

1943
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:01,461
Oh, that's a new one.

1944
01:56:04,135 --> 01:56:06,676
Okay, Ortha, ready to go now?

1945
01:56:11,275 --> 01:56:13,408
I'm a bit worried about the wind

1946
01:56:13,759 --> 01:56:17,202
spot landings are tricky with
heavy crosswinds. Even for me.

1947
01:56:17,534 --> 01:56:18,894
But I'll make do.

1948
01:56:19,376 --> 01:56:21,243
Then let's get on the truck.

1949
01:56:38,869 --> 01:56:42,949
I... I really don't like
small enclosed spaces.

1950
01:56:43,267 --> 01:56:45,467
I've been in a cage for too long.

1951
01:56:46,262 --> 01:56:49,162
We'll be by your side
the whole time. Relax.

1952
01:56:49,485 --> 01:56:51,551
There's nothing to worry about.

1953
01:56:52,313 --> 01:56:54,107
If you say so...

1954
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:05,405
Wait... Wait... something
doesn't smell right...

1955
01:57:05,898 --> 01:57:08,679
GET BEHIND ME! IT'S A TRAP!

1956
01:57:20,348 --> 01:57:22,482
Don't shoot... we need her alive!

1957
01:57:34,466 --> 01:57:36,200
I said don't shoot at her!

1958
01:57:41,237 --> 01:57:42,517
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

1959
01:57:59,473 --> 01:58:01,806
Bloody tranquilizer is not working!

1960
01:58:01,982 --> 01:58:03,662
You can do it, Ortha!

1961
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:27,932
Oh f.. Shit, I'm out of ammo!

1962
01:58:28,015 --> 01:58:30,082
Why didn't you shoot the tires?

1963
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:32,386
BECAUSE WE WOULD BE DEAD NOW!

1964
01:58:33,966 --> 01:58:35,646
No!

1965
01:58:36,065 --> 01:58:38,378
Ortha! No, Ortha!

1966
01:58:38,457 --> 01:58:39,657
Don't give in!

1967
01:58:39,682 --> 01:58:42,016
You have to get off the truck, now!

1968
01:58:42,209 --> 01:58:43,209
Come on!

1969
01:58:43,448 --> 01:58:44,313
They...

1970
01:58:44,373 --> 01:58:46,356
I think they poisoned me...

1971
01:58:46,467 --> 01:58:49,202
-What?
-I can't move my legs any more...

1972
01:58:49,234 --> 01:58:50,973
NO! ORTHA!

1973
01:58:53,495 --> 01:58:54,495
Run!

1974
01:58:54,785 --> 01:58:56,676
Run, you fools!

1975
01:58:56,999 --> 01:58:58,983
No! Florence, help me pull!

1976
01:58:59,052 --> 01:59:00,173
Come one!

1977
01:59:04,391 --> 01:59:06,391
She's way too heavy!

1978
01:59:07,958 --> 01:59:08,958
Cal!

1979
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:11,251
I'm not going to let you go!

1980
01:59:11,355 --> 01:59:12,355
Ever!

1981
01:59:16,053 --> 01:59:16,960
Cal...

1982
01:59:16,985 --> 01:59:19,052
this is our last chance to run!

1983
01:59:20,671 --> 01:59:21,711
RUN YOU IDIOT

1984
01:59:31,011 --> 01:59:37,487

Oh damn, my glass is empty again.

1989
01:59:55,301 --> 01:59:57,279
Let me fix that.

1990
01:59:59,573 --> 02:00:01,992
This is really fine wine.

1991
02:00:02,246 --> 02:00:04,380
It must have cost you a fortune!

1992
02:00:04,765 --> 02:00:05,765
Not really.

1993
02:00:06,082 --> 02:00:10,512
You know what's better than being the
official confectioner of the royal family?

1994
02:00:10,537 --> 02:00:14,662
Being the favorite confectioner
of the royal family's staff.

1995
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:18,038
Lowly working folk like
us take care of each other.

1996
02:00:18,401 --> 02:00:19,869
I see! - *hic!*

1997
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:22,934
I have to restrain myself

1998
02:00:23,062 --> 02:00:25,298
or I won't be able to walk you home!

1999
02:00:25,362 --> 02:00:27,392
Who said I'm going home tonight?

2000
02:00:27,436 --> 02:00:28,515
Oh!

2001
02:00:28,602 --> 02:00:30,901
But don't you have to work tomorrow?

2002
02:00:30,989 --> 02:00:35,806
Every single person in this
goddamn bakery is always late!

2003
02:00:35,934 --> 02:00:38,834
Why can't I be the one
who's late for once?

2004
02:00:38,908 --> 02:00:40,365
Too right.

2005
02:00:40,583 --> 02:00:43,333
To hell with work! Cheers!

2006
02:00:43,381 --> 02:00:44,381
Cheers!

2007
02:00:46,916 --> 02:00:49,382
What on earth is going on out there?

2008
02:00:49,975 --> 02:00:52,253
The fire station is around the corner

2009
02:00:52,325 --> 02:00:54,525
you get used to it after a while.

2010
02:00:54,698 --> 02:00:57,834
There are so many ways
to set your house ablaze...

2011
02:00:57,953 --> 02:01:01,832
Forgetting the pot in the
oven, smoking in bed...

2012
02:01:01,951 --> 02:01:06,306
Did you know more than 5000
people die that way every year?

2013
02:01:06,683 --> 02:01:08,283
[Radio] Ladies and Gentlemen

2014
02:01:08,351 --> 02:01:12,125
we interrupt this program to
bring you a special news bulletin.

2015
02:01:12,356 --> 02:01:16,964
An ongoing series of explosions is
still shaking the city of Port Ospen.

2016
02:01:17,345 --> 02:01:21,662
The police department reported
another detonation around 11 pm

2017
02:01:21,797 --> 02:01:23,477
at a bakery on Lewse Road

2018
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:26,203
- Lewse Road? That's my shop!
- following the attack on the Peter M. Harrington

2019
02:01:26,262 --> 02:01:28,504
-Abe, that is MY SHOP!
-airfield the day before.

2020
02:01:28,758 --> 02:01:30,902
-For god's sake! It is!
-The building is on fire

2021
02:01:31,027 --> 02:01:32,527
and has partly collapsed.

2022
02:01:32,575 --> 02:01:33,872
-Florence...
-What?

2023
02:01:33,897 --> 02:01:36,188
Something must have happened to Florence!

2024
02:01:36,244 --> 02:01:37,244
Eva, wait!

2025
02:01:37,758 --> 02:01:39,922
What does Florence have to do with this?

2026
02:01:40,032 --> 02:01:41,409
She isn't even here!

2027
02:01:41,497 --> 02:01:42,923
You don't understand!

2028
02:01:43,003 --> 02:01:44,435
Damn right I don't!

2029
02:01:44,475 --> 02:01:46,155
Those were no terrorists.

2030
02:01:46,308 --> 02:01:47,348
It was Welsh.

2031
02:01:47,393 --> 02:01:48,659
He wants to kill me!

2032
02:01:48,684 --> 02:01:50,364
Because Florence is dead!

2033
02:01:50,433 --> 02:01:52,091
-Why?
-I already told you

2034
02:01:52,116 --> 02:01:53,796
I can't talk about it!

2035
02:01:54,028 --> 02:01:56,296
Eva, please, I'm on your side.

2036
02:01:56,443 --> 02:01:58,123
Please let me help you.

2037
02:01:58,325 --> 02:01:59,605
Please trust me.

2038
02:02:00,789 --> 02:02:01,829
You're right.

2039
02:02:02,148 --> 02:02:03,828
It's too late anyway.

2040
02:02:03,953 --> 02:02:05,953
Peter was a genius, you know?

2041
02:02:06,101 --> 02:02:10,000
If he had an idea, he would
spend days locked up in his office.

2042
02:02:10,025 --> 02:02:13,058
And the more people told him
that something was impossible

2043
02:02:13,122 --> 02:02:15,669
the more stubbornly he would move forward.

2044
02:02:15,694 --> 02:02:18,496
But a businessman he was not.

2045
02:02:18,758 --> 02:02:21,209
He knew Welsh from his university days

2046
02:02:21,234 --> 02:02:25,359
and with his MBA degree he seemed
to be a good man to partner up with.

2047
02:02:25,647 --> 02:02:27,622
At first, all was great.

2048
02:02:27,936 --> 02:02:31,584
Welsh secured funding, ran
the books and hired new staff.

2049
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:34,964
Peter was happy as long
as we didn't have to starve.

2050
02:02:35,397 --> 02:02:37,516
Welsh, however, wanted more.

2051
02:02:37,747 --> 02:02:41,027
When the kingdom began
to arm itself against Vanos

2052
02:02:41,162 --> 02:02:43,382
Welsh saw a golden opportunity.

2053
02:02:43,962 --> 02:02:47,213
When Peter refused, Welsh threw a tantrum.

2054
02:02:47,333 --> 02:02:51,481
'Unfit for business, unfit
for life', that's what he yelled

2055
02:02:51,537 --> 02:02:54,086
and then he slammed
the door in Peter's face.

2056
02:02:54,111 --> 02:02:57,602
And he hated Peter so
much that he had him killed?

2057
02:02:57,849 --> 02:02:59,280
It wasn't even hate.

2058
02:02:59,598 --> 02:03:03,118
For him it was more like a
change in business strategy.

2059
02:03:03,378 --> 02:03:06,834
Removing the single point
of failure from the process.

2060
02:03:06,858 --> 02:03:10,896
All he had to do was to disable
the fuel gauge on Peter's plane.

2061
02:03:10,921 --> 02:03:13,901
A murderer AND a coward...

2062
02:03:14,393 --> 02:03:16,610
Welsh took me aside during the funeral

2063
02:03:16,809 --> 02:03:18,389
and told me what he did.

2064
02:03:18,413 --> 02:03:21,190
And that Florence would
soon share Peter's fate

2065
02:03:21,215 --> 02:03:24,415
if I didn't voluntarily
relinquish my inheritance.

2066
02:03:24,549 --> 02:03:27,332
What stopped him from
killing both of you anyways

2067
02:03:27,357 --> 02:03:29,067
after he got what he wanted?

2068
02:03:29,231 --> 02:03:30,186
I'm not sure.

2069
02:03:30,211 --> 02:03:32,829
Maybe my relationship to the royals.

2070
02:03:32,996 --> 02:03:35,190
I've been living in fear ever since.

2071
02:03:35,438 --> 02:03:40,715
And I tried to keep Florence as safe and as
far away from anything that Welsh controls.

2072
02:03:40,911 --> 02:03:42,771
That he tries to kill me now

2073
02:03:42,796 --> 02:03:46,252
after so many years of
silence can't be a coincidence.

2074
02:03:46,548 --> 02:03:50,896
Something must have happened that
made him think he can no longer control me.

2075
02:03:50,952 --> 02:03:53,214
Something must have happened to Florence!

2076
02:03:53,255 --> 02:03:56,175
If that is true, you should stay here.

2077
02:03:56,562 --> 02:03:58,242
Nobody knows you're here.

2078
02:03:58,590 --> 02:04:00,868
Don't let Welsh know
that you're still alive.

2079
02:04:00,893 --> 02:04:03,390
And then... what next, Abe?

2080
02:04:03,661 --> 02:04:04,951
What about Florence?

2081
02:04:04,976 --> 02:04:06,016
And my house?

2082
02:04:06,324 --> 02:04:09,007
I can't just sit here and do nothing!

2083
02:04:09,191 --> 02:04:12,452
My life just went up in
flames, don't you understand?

2084
02:04:12,563 --> 02:04:14,083
We'll find a a way.

2085
02:04:14,304 --> 02:04:15,764
We're the good guys, Eva.

2086
02:04:15,797 --> 02:04:17,930
The good guys always find a way.

2087
02:04:27,814 --> 02:04:33,496
[applause]

2088
02:04:37,458 --> 02:04:41,016
Florence, Cal, what on earth happened?

2089
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:43,310
Illyan betrayed us!

2090
02:04:43,579 --> 02:04:45,681
We were ambushed by Welsh's henchmen.

2091
02:04:45,705 --> 02:04:47,385
They shot everyone down.

2092
02:04:50,148 --> 02:04:51,953
Oh my Lord! Will?

2093
02:04:52,097 --> 02:04:53,097
Will!

2094
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,667
He's the only one still breathing.

2095
02:05:02,685 --> 02:05:04,365
Everyone else is dead.

2096
02:05:07,825 --> 02:05:10,537
Illyan, that bastard!

2097
02:05:10,792 --> 02:05:14,179
I always knew something
was sketchy about him...

2098
02:05:16,876 --> 02:05:17,876
Will!

2099
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:19,839
WILL! Talk to me!

2100
02:05:19,874 --> 02:05:20,874
DAMN!

2101
02:05:22,253 --> 02:05:25,367
You two stay here and have an eye on him

2102
02:05:25,771 --> 02:05:27,371
I'll go get the doctor!

2103
02:05:28,179 --> 02:05:30,543
Be quick, he's bleeding to death!

2104
02:05:30,872 --> 02:05:33,191
Then do something about it!

2105
02:05:40,022 --> 02:05:43,253
Cal, come over here and help me!

2106
02:05:43,515 --> 02:05:45,195
What am I supposed to do?

2107
02:05:45,902 --> 02:05:47,582
Get me some fresh towels.

2108
02:05:48,549 --> 02:05:49,549
Allright.

2109
02:06:02,739 --> 02:06:04,360
So what now?

2110
02:06:04,928 --> 02:06:06,989
We're going to make a tourniquet.

2111
02:06:07,183 --> 02:06:09,111
A... A what?

2112
02:06:09,358 --> 02:06:10,722
A tourniquet!

2113
02:06:10,897 --> 02:06:12,846
They taught me how to make people bleed

2114
02:06:12,871 --> 02:06:15,591
not the other way around!
What the fuck is a tourniquet?

2115
02:06:16,153 --> 02:06:19,115
I'll fold up this towel
and put it on the wound.

2116
02:06:19,131 --> 02:06:23,378
Now take the other towel,
and tie it down really tight.

2117
02:06:23,525 --> 02:06:25,658
The pressure stops the bleeding, allright?

2118
02:06:26,123 --> 02:06:27,123
Allright.

2119
02:06:29,951 --> 02:06:31,015
Good!

2120
02:06:33,790 --> 02:06:36,866
I think that's pretty much
all we can do for now.

2121
02:06:38,845 --> 02:06:41,602
How... How do you know all this?

2122
02:06:42,162 --> 02:06:44,750
Father insisted I take the courses.

2123
02:06:45,770 --> 02:06:47,445
I was the only girl in the class.

2124
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:51,206
And the boys beat each other up
who's gonna be the next dummy!

2125
02:06:51,719 --> 02:06:52,719
Wait...

2126
02:06:54,262 --> 02:06:55,813
Is he still breathing?

2127
02:06:55,902 --> 02:06:56,902
What?

2128
02:06:58,809 --> 02:06:59,809
No!

2129
02:06:59,847 --> 02:07:02,181
Nonono, we're losing him!

2130
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:04,400
Shit.

2131
02:07:04,667 --> 02:07:06,576
One. Two. Three.

2132
02:07:06,825 --> 02:07:08,746
Four. Five. Six

2133
02:07:08,859 --> 02:07:10,619
Seven. Eight. Nine.

2134
02:07:10,715 --> 02:07:13,792
I am the one who
deserves to die, not Will!

2135
02:07:14,651 --> 02:07:17,082
I am guilty of this whole mess

2136
02:07:17,933 --> 02:07:18,723
One.

2137
02:07:18,747 --> 02:07:21,308
as much as Welsh himself is guilty!

2138
02:07:21,539 --> 02:07:23,747
Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

2139
02:07:23,772 --> 02:07:26,935
I used to be one of his
men! How could I? HOW?

2140
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:31,029
I'm not going to give up on him just yet!

2141
02:07:32,036 --> 02:07:36,083
Jack and Sly are gone! What is
going to become of their families?

2142
02:07:36,147 --> 02:07:37,347
Their children?

2143
02:07:38,393 --> 02:07:41,666
Working for Welsh always
felt like a game, but suddenly

2144
02:07:42,177 --> 02:07:43,857
it's all dead serious!

2145
02:07:45,021 --> 02:07:47,202
I did whatever Welsh wanted

2146
02:07:47,227 --> 02:07:49,443
to whoever he wantet me do it to, but

2147
02:07:49,518 --> 02:07:51,585
I never felt anything for them.

2148
02:07:51,913 --> 02:07:54,113
But these are my friends!

2149
02:07:55,768 --> 02:07:57,826
I'm such a piece of shit!

2150
02:07:57,951 --> 02:08:00,895
Oh will you shut up
and stop pitying yourself!

2151
02:08:01,474 --> 02:08:03,407
This is hard enough as it is!

2152
02:08:07,659 --> 02:08:08,659
Yes!

2153
02:08:09,545 --> 02:08:10,545
That did it!

2154
02:08:24,156 --> 02:08:26,794
Get in there, move, move, move!

2155
02:08:29,722 --> 02:08:31,402
Thank god you're here!

2156
02:08:32,263 --> 02:08:34,730
Don't set your expectations too high.

2157
02:08:34,804 --> 02:08:38,132
I had to pluck him from
under a table at the tavern.

2158
02:08:38,213 --> 02:08:42,523
Why can't a man enjoy
his time after work?

2159
02:08:43,135 --> 02:08:46,383
Listen, my husband is dying

2160
02:08:46,501 --> 02:08:50,661
if you want to be able to enjoy
anything in your life after today

2161
02:08:51,024 --> 02:08:53,745
you'd better MOVE YOUR
BUTT AND DO YOUR WORK!

2162
02:08:56,553 --> 02:08:57,553
Okay.

2163
02:08:58,572 --> 02:08:59,867
lets see...

2164
02:09:03,688 --> 02:09:05,365
The victim...

2165
02:09:05,655 --> 02:09:07,971
No! The patient...

2166
02:09:08,884 --> 02:09:11,283
he looks kinda miserable.

2167
02:09:13,703 --> 02:09:15,383
What happened to him?

2168
02:09:16,393 --> 02:09:18,341
Well, he got shot at.

2169
02:09:18,862 --> 02:09:23,207
Three hits, one to the
shoulder, two to the thigh.

2170
02:09:24,998 --> 02:09:27,110
Good, good!

2171
02:09:27,892 --> 02:09:28,892
What?!

2172
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:33,931
Yeah, no vital organs in there.

2173
02:09:37,749 --> 02:09:39,867
Does he bleed from both sides?

2174
02:09:39,947 --> 02:09:43,576
Uhm... yeah, kinda...

2175
02:09:43,601 --> 02:09:45,319
Lucky Bastard.

2176
02:09:45,604 --> 02:09:46,604
What?

2177
02:09:46,919 --> 02:09:51,187
What are you talking about,
he's in a goddamn coma!

2178
02:09:51,291 --> 02:09:54,245
Sure, he's lost a lot of blood.

2179
02:09:55,064 --> 02:09:58,968
But it means the bullets
went straight through.

2180
02:09:59,819 --> 02:10:01,909
A lot less damage that way, and

2181
02:10:01,934 --> 02:10:06,624
you wouldn't want me to poke
around inside of him right now!

2182
02:10:08,538 --> 02:10:09,538
Let's see.

2183
02:10:18,594 --> 02:10:20,464
Ah, yeah. This right here.

2184
02:10:21,161 --> 02:10:23,454
Eh, honey

2185
02:10:24,014 --> 02:10:27,384
if you would be so
nice to hold this for me.

2186
02:10:29,230 --> 02:10:30,372
Thank you.

2187
02:10:31,065 --> 02:10:32,065
Now...

2188
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:36,192
Step back.

2189
02:10:39,515 --> 02:10:40,515
Ready...

2190
02:10:42,264 --> 02:10:43,487
Set...

2191
02:10:44,693 --> 02:10:45,693
Go!

2192
02:10:45,964 --> 02:10:47,283
Ouch!

2193
02:10:48,243 --> 02:10:50,169
Ha-ha, bullseye!

2194
02:10:50,213 --> 02:10:51,371
Fifty points!

2195
02:10:51,553 --> 02:10:53,985
Good thing he's unconscious.

2196
02:10:56,497 --> 02:11:02,742
[applause]

2197
02:11:04,286 --> 02:11:07,780
A stiff drink gives you a steady hand!

2198
02:11:09,329 --> 02:11:11,063
What is this?

2199
02:11:13,645 --> 02:11:15,013
Shal...

2200
02:11:16,356 --> 02:11:19,215
shaline sholushion.

2201
02:11:21,667 --> 02:11:24,301
Not as good as fresh blood

2202
02:11:24,675 --> 02:11:28,143
but it'll give the old
heart something to pump.

2203
02:11:28,634 --> 02:11:33,517
If we manage to pour more of
this in than blood comes out of there

2204
02:11:34,806 --> 02:11:36,940
he'll make it through the night.

2205
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:41,421
Now I... I need a bowl of water

2206
02:11:41,446 --> 02:11:44,993
and a bottle of stroooooong alcohol.

2207
02:11:45,146 --> 02:11:47,523
Allright! I'll get the water.

2208
02:11:52,021 --> 02:11:54,553
This is for disinfection, right?

2209
02:11:55,041 --> 02:11:57,104
Damn straight! Give me that!

2210
02:12:00,403 --> 02:12:01,943
HURGH!

2211
02:12:08,250 --> 02:12:11,816
I guess that's all the help
we are going to get for tonight.

2212
02:12:12,335 --> 02:12:16,396
Yes, but I think I can take over from here.

2213
02:12:18,002 --> 02:12:19,733
Stay strong Mae.

2214
02:12:19,805 --> 02:12:21,638
Stay strong.

2215
02:12:32,118 --> 02:12:33,118
Um...

2216
02:12:34,237 --> 02:12:35,237
Hey.

2217
02:12:36,441 --> 02:12:37,441
Hey.

2218
02:12:38,462 --> 02:12:39,902
How are you doing?

2219
02:12:42,876 --> 02:12:44,676
I've never felt so useless.

2220
02:12:44,927 --> 02:12:45,927
Yeah

2221
02:12:46,255 --> 02:12:47,855
I know that feeling.

2222
02:12:48,451 --> 02:12:51,736
When my life suddenly changed
from airplanes to cream puffs

2223
02:12:51,761 --> 02:12:53,441
it was just the same.

2224
02:12:53,988 --> 02:12:57,444
Our only friend out here is
dying on the kitchen table

2225
02:12:58,392 --> 02:13:02,783
even the goddamn shitfaced
doctor is more useful than I am.

2226
02:13:04,525 --> 02:13:08,610
I used to be strong
and in control of my life.

2227
02:13:09,052 --> 02:13:10,252
Now look at me.

2228
02:13:11,336 --> 02:13:15,304
For the most part of your life,
you only had to follow orders.

2229
02:13:15,693 --> 02:13:19,351
You didn't give a damn about
anything because you didn't have to.

2230
02:13:20,035 --> 02:13:21,587
But now you do!

2231
02:13:21,945 --> 02:13:24,523
This is how it feels to care!

2232
02:13:24,857 --> 02:13:27,724
You're finally taking control of your life!

2233
02:13:28,470 --> 02:13:32,023
Then why the fuck am I so scared?!

2234
02:13:32,620 --> 02:13:36,489
Finding a new purpose
in life is a scary thing.

2235
02:13:38,017 --> 02:13:39,697
So what is my purpose?

2236
02:13:40,194 --> 02:13:41,714
Why settle for one?

2237
02:13:41,899 --> 02:13:45,858
For me, there are so many
things that give life meaning!

2238
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:51,245
Happy ones, like supporting my
mother or bringing joy to my friends.

2239
02:13:51,612 --> 02:13:55,853
Dark ones, like avenging
the death of my father.

2240
02:13:56,115 --> 02:13:59,949
Or simple ones, like
just enjoying the day.

2241
02:14:01,404 --> 02:14:04,904
The only thing I can think
about right now is Ortha!

2242
02:14:05,072 --> 02:14:07,037
Then Ortha it is.

2243
02:14:07,264 --> 02:14:10,131
She has definitely
awoken something in you.

2244
02:14:10,347 --> 02:14:13,611
Something that has lain
dormant for way too long.

2245
02:14:13,786 --> 02:14:15,466
Something beautiful!

2246
02:14:15,905 --> 02:14:19,233
You know what separates
good people from bad people?

2247
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:20,960
The good ones can change

2248
02:14:21,342 --> 02:14:23,475
and they will always find a way.

2249
02:14:23,774 --> 02:14:28,944
If there were a way to save
Ortha, I wouldn't be sitting here!

2250
02:14:29,261 --> 02:14:30,861
But there might be!

2251
02:14:31,492 --> 02:14:33,131
Let's get some sleep.

2252
02:14:33,203 --> 02:14:37,254
And tomorrow, we're going
to make a few phone calls.

2253
02:14:43,633 --> 02:14:53,215
[applause]

2254
02:14:56,015 --> 02:14:57,015
Eva...

2255
02:14:57,335 --> 02:14:58,591
Hey, Eva...

2256
02:14:59,033 --> 02:15:00,033
come on...

2257
02:15:00,318 --> 02:15:01,318
wake up!

2258
02:15:02,443 --> 02:15:03,443
Mmm...

2259
02:15:03,827 --> 02:15:05,676
Hrmblbrmglbmlml

2260
02:15:06,682 --> 02:15:08,791
-I've got great news!
-What?

2261
02:15:09,038 --> 02:15:10,038
What is it?

2262
02:15:10,899 --> 02:15:12,579
Florence just called!

2263
02:15:12,878 --> 02:15:13,878
Really?

2264
02:15:13,903 --> 02:15:15,343
She's in St. Eliza

2265
02:15:15,394 --> 02:15:17,594
she's free, and she's doing fine!

2266
02:15:18,658 --> 02:15:19,954
Oh, thank god...

2267
02:15:19,979 --> 02:15:21,476
is she still on the line?

2268
02:15:21,508 --> 02:15:22,698
Can I talk to her?

2269
02:15:22,739 --> 02:15:25,331
Uhh sorry, she called about an hour ago.

2270
02:15:25,789 --> 02:15:27,908
Why didn't you wake me up right away?

2271
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:29,940
You lay awake the whole night.

2272
02:15:29,965 --> 02:15:32,061
I didn't have the heart to wake you up.

2273
02:15:32,117 --> 02:15:35,206
Besides, she was calling
from the post office, and

2274
02:15:35,278 --> 02:15:37,114
she had a long line behind her.

2275
02:15:37,162 --> 02:15:38,983
But I've got the motorbike fixed up

2276
02:15:39,031 --> 02:15:42,707
and I'm going to pick her up
in St. Eliza in about an hour.

2277
02:15:42,779 --> 02:15:46,875
So she'll soon be here and you'll
be able to talk to her in person.

2278
02:15:46,910 --> 02:15:49,342
She's got one hell of a story to tell.

2279
02:15:49,367 --> 02:15:51,065
Did she tell you what happened?

2280
02:15:51,161 --> 02:15:53,095
Naa, only the essentials.

2281
02:15:53,223 --> 02:15:55,031
She escaped, she's fine

2282
02:15:55,127 --> 02:15:58,035
she knows everything about
the conspiracy against you

2283
02:15:58,099 --> 02:16:00,569
and she needs our help to end it!

2284
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:02,045
Wait, what?

2285
02:16:02,125 --> 02:16:03,645
Yeah, you heard me right.

2286
02:16:03,677 --> 02:16:07,146
She has a plan, and
she insists we play along.

2287
02:16:07,250 --> 02:16:08,642
We'll see about that.

2288
02:16:08,698 --> 02:16:12,210
She wants us to get her
and a friend into the palace.

2289
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:14,016
They would still let you
in, wouldn't they?

2290
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:16,054
Only when I'm making a delivery.

2291
02:16:16,126 --> 02:16:20,395
But my kitchen was in my house
and my house went up in flames.

2292
02:16:20,459 --> 02:16:23,102
But if you could, you could get us in?

2293
02:16:23,150 --> 02:16:24,082
Maybe.

2294
02:16:24,107 --> 02:16:25,515
Hah! Excellent.

2295
02:16:25,635 --> 02:16:30,647
I once fixed a friend's car for
free, and now he kinda owes me a favor.

2296
02:16:30,772 --> 02:16:33,765
His sister owns Cantrell's
Bakery in Herringstown

2297
02:16:33,821 --> 02:16:35,664
and she has everything we need.

2298
02:16:35,689 --> 02:16:38,500
She expects you to be there at noon.

2299
02:16:38,674 --> 02:16:41,782
Abe, I'm not even fully awake yet...

2300
02:16:41,862 --> 02:16:44,806
Oh, and since you won't
be able to do it alone

2301
02:16:44,890 --> 02:16:48,198
I've also sent the neighbor's boy
to wake up all of your employees

2302
02:16:48,238 --> 02:16:50,639
and send them to Herringstown right away.

2303
02:16:50,679 --> 02:16:51,799
Be honest, Abe

2304
02:16:51,891 --> 02:16:56,001
the only reason you didn't wake me
up was that you were afraid I'd stop you.

2305
02:16:56,089 --> 02:16:59,163
This is crazy, even by
Florence's standards!

2306
02:16:59,312 --> 02:17:02,283
Do you think she'd have
accepted no as an answer?

2307
02:17:02,315 --> 02:17:04,682
She's Peter's girl after all!

2308
02:17:05,207 --> 02:17:07,940
You didn't even tell me what the plan is!

2309
02:17:08,018 --> 02:17:10,751
I can't, because if I did, you'd stop me.

2310
02:17:11,141 --> 02:17:13,576
Now, if you will please excuse me...

2311
02:17:13,632 --> 02:17:15,483
Abe, for heaven's sake!

2312
02:17:15,687 --> 02:17:17,491
Where are you going?

2313
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:18,803
To St. Eliza.

2314
02:17:18,875 --> 02:17:20,502
Picking up Florence and Cal.

2315
02:17:20,527 --> 02:17:23,595
Cal? As in Cal Davis?

2316
02:17:23,635 --> 02:17:26,777
Oh, didn't I mention that
he's on our side now?

2317
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:29,433
I need a cup of coffee.

2318
02:17:29,548 --> 02:17:31,010
It's on the kitchen table!

2319
02:17:31,042 --> 02:17:32,042
I... uh...

2320
02:17:32,067 --> 02:17:33,514
Now what are you waiting for?

2321
02:17:33,539 --> 02:17:34,778
It's time to get ready!

2322
02:17:34,803 --> 02:17:36,226
FOR WHAT?

2323
02:17:36,274 --> 02:17:37,998
To bake a cake.

2324
02:17:38,184 --> 02:17:39,304
FOR THE QUEEN!

2325
02:18:00,948 --> 02:18:04,186
[applause]

2326
02:18:05,832 --> 02:18:07,965
Oh, I hate ceremonial occasions.

2327
02:18:08,009 --> 02:18:11,994
Always the same people,
always the same endless smalltalk.

2328
02:18:12,066 --> 02:18:13,746
Such a waste of time.

2329
02:18:13,983 --> 02:18:17,786
Well, this is going to be
different, let me promise you that!

2330
02:18:17,937 --> 02:18:19,884
Really? Well, we'll see.

2331
02:18:19,916 --> 02:18:23,124
The best thing about these
receptions is usually the cake.

2332
02:18:23,260 --> 02:18:24,422
Didn't you hear?

2333
02:18:24,447 --> 02:18:26,714
Eva Harrington's shop burned down!

2334
02:18:26,755 --> 02:18:27,722
What?

2335
02:18:27,747 --> 02:18:28,947
No cake at all?

2336
02:18:29,255 --> 02:18:31,588
All right, that's it. I'm leaving...

2337
02:18:32,461 --> 02:18:34,342
Ladies and Gentlemen

2338
02:18:35,852 --> 02:18:38,818
let's raise our glasses to Irdis the First

2339
02:18:38,998 --> 02:18:42,582
by the Grace of Gods, Queen
of the Kingdom of Great Astar

2340
02:18:42,804 --> 02:18:44,944
Defender of the Faith!

2341
02:18:45,253 --> 02:18:46,340
The Queen!

2342
02:18:51,929 --> 02:18:54,662
My Lords and friends of the Royal Family.

2343
02:18:55,124 --> 02:18:58,622
The people of Great
Astar are diligent and fertile.

2344
02:18:58,900 --> 02:19:01,158
But we do not know for how much longer

2345
02:19:01,183 --> 02:19:05,893
the land that our thriving industry
is built upon will be able support it.

2346
02:19:06,050 --> 02:19:08,372
We have reached a point where our borders

2347
02:19:08,397 --> 02:19:11,469
are no longer restricted
by opposing territories

2348
02:19:11,770 --> 02:19:14,636
but by the mere coastline of our continent.

2349
02:19:15,461 --> 02:19:18,115
To conquer new lands we must now go

2350
02:19:18,171 --> 02:19:20,104
where no one has gone before.

2351
02:19:20,734 --> 02:19:21,854
In this matter

2352
02:19:22,006 --> 02:19:24,970
I have invited the esteemed Mr. Welsh

2353
02:19:24,995 --> 02:19:28,195
who is going to talk
about his latest discoveries.

2354
02:19:30,477 --> 02:19:33,104
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2355
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:38,272
A few weeks ago, we have returned
from our Trans Oceanic Expedition

2356
02:19:38,336 --> 02:19:40,452
and we...

2357
02:19:42,485 --> 02:19:44,165
Who in God's…

2358
02:19:47,743 --> 02:19:49,698
EVA HARRINGTON?!

2359
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:52,478
Oooh, and she brought the cake!

2360
02:19:52,577 --> 02:19:55,380
Ahh! It's so beautiful!

2361
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:58,555
I'm so sorry Mr. Welsh

2362
02:19:58,619 --> 02:20:01,993
I didn't mean to interrupt
you! Please, go on!

2363
02:20:02,446 --> 02:20:06,280
Alright, what kind of
game is being played here?

2364
02:20:06,352 --> 02:20:08,032
I beg your pardon, sir?

2365
02:20:08,164 --> 02:20:10,528
I'm delivering the cake you ordered!

2366
02:20:10,592 --> 02:20:12,264
How is this even possible?

2367
02:20:12,312 --> 02:20:15,212
By the skilled work
of artisan pastry chefs!

2368
02:20:16,046 --> 02:20:18,357
This has to be a trap, right?

2369
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:20,594
No... It's a family recipe!

2370
02:20:25,429 --> 02:20:29,640
Well then, thank you for
the cake, Mrs. Harringon.

2371
02:20:29,863 --> 02:20:33,104
YOU MAY NOW LEAVE.

2372
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:37,911
God save the Queen!

2373
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:40,737
Yeah, yeah.

2374
02:20:42,241 --> 02:20:44,948
Now look at this!

2375
02:20:45,353 --> 02:20:47,077
This work of arts!

2376
02:20:47,266 --> 02:20:49,910
So much CHOCOLATE

2377
02:20:49,997 --> 02:20:52,116
And cherries on top!

2378
02:20:55,794 --> 02:20:56,794
Fine...

2379
02:21:05,326 --> 02:21:07,689
But I bet you didn't
expect that I could do THIS!

2380
02:21:07,743 --> 02:21:08,743
HAH!

2381
02:21:10,628 --> 02:21:12,428
Ehehehehe...

2382
02:21:13,391 --> 02:21:14,671
A nice trick, huh?

2383
02:21:15,024 --> 02:21:17,158
My father used to be a magician!

2384
02:21:20,382 --> 02:21:24,209
Mr. Welsh, your behavior is most peculiar.

2385
02:21:24,325 --> 02:21:26,525
Is everything all right with you?

2386
02:21:27,923 --> 02:21:32,394
Oh, yes, of course,
your Highness, of course.

2387
02:21:32,843 --> 02:21:37,221
I am sorry, I think the
workload is getting to me.

2388
02:21:37,696 --> 02:21:40,563
Anyways, let's go on with the presentation.

2389
02:21:45,144 --> 02:21:46,184
Where was I...

2390
02:21:47,495 --> 02:21:52,148
Yes, the ex-oceanic
transped... Transpedition…

2391
02:21:52,216 --> 02:21:55,132
I mean, the Trans Oceanic Expedition.

2392
02:21:55,860 --> 02:22:00,555
Eh... at the perils of our lives, my
men and I have found a new continent

2393
02:22:00,679 --> 02:22:04,687
that shall from now on be known as Irdisia

2394
02:22:05,347 --> 02:22:10,739
in honor of... uhm...
Majesty the Queen of Great Astar!

2395
02:22:11,303 --> 02:22:14,974
It's a land... rich of... many riches, like

2396
02:22:14,999 --> 02:22:17,905
trees... mountains... rivers!

2397
02:22:18,762 --> 02:22:22,080
The... the coast is
guarded by flying beasts

2398
02:22:22,105 --> 02:22:24,305
against whom we prevailed

2399
02:22:24,330 --> 02:22:28,072
and one of which I hereby
present to you, your Majesty

2400
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:30,428
as gift and sign of loyalty!

2401
02:22:30,877 --> 02:22:33,796
Behold, THE BEAST!

2402
02:22:41,025 --> 02:22:42,551
As you can see...

2403
02:22:43,001 --> 02:22:45,381
it is very dangerous!

2404
02:22:56,663 --> 02:22:57,839
As I said

2405
02:22:57,961 --> 02:22:58,961
dangerous!

2406
02:22:59,795 --> 02:23:02,840
IT'S WELSH! RIGHT THERE!

2407
02:23:03,315 --> 02:23:05,428
Open the cage! Now!

2408
02:23:05,616 --> 02:23:07,410
Ignore Welsh, Ortha.

2409
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:08,808
Remember our plan?

2410
02:23:08,874 --> 02:23:12,460
Go for the Queen! The
rest will sort itself out!

2411
02:23:13,145 --> 02:23:15,542
OH I HATE HIM SO MUCH!

2412
02:23:15,777 --> 02:23:18,146
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM!

2413
02:23:18,182 --> 02:23:21,638
KILL HIM! KILL HIM! KILL!

2414
02:23:24,174 --> 02:23:25,900
Florence! Now?

2415
02:23:25,951 --> 02:23:27,905
NO! Don't open the cage!

2416
02:23:27,941 --> 02:23:29,840
Something's wrong with her!

2417
02:23:29,872 --> 02:23:32,332
But we can't wait any
longer! It's now or never!

2418
02:23:34,401 --> 02:23:35,401
No!

2419
02:23:35,593 --> 02:23:36,593
What?

2420
02:23:38,627 --> 02:23:39,987
What's happening?

2421
02:23:43,250 --> 02:23:46,514
DON'T CALL THE GUARDS OR
YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET IT!

2422
02:23:52,543 --> 02:23:54,712
Ortha, what are you doing?!

2423
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:57,200
AAH!

2424
02:23:58,537 --> 02:24:02,346
So, what are you going to do, Florence?

2425
02:24:02,450 --> 02:24:04,183
Going to shoot me?

2426
02:24:04,575 --> 02:24:05,575
No!

2427
02:24:05,789 --> 02:24:10,733
THEN... GET... OUT... OF... MY... WAY!

2428
02:24:10,758 --> 02:24:11,758
ARGH!

2429
02:24:17,708 --> 02:24:21,680
Quick, get inside the cage...
it's the only place you'll be safe!

2430
02:24:22,448 --> 02:24:23,448
Help me!

2431
02:24:23,933 --> 02:24:25,867
What the hell is Ortha doing?

2432
02:24:28,435 --> 02:24:30,115
I don't want to die!

2433
02:24:30,170 --> 02:24:34,394
Her hate for Welsh is so strong,
it almost knocked me off my feet!

2434
02:24:34,625 --> 02:24:36,305
She's out of control!

2435
02:24:37,873 --> 02:24:40,473
You have to get her back to her senses!

2436
02:24:41,615 --> 02:24:42,655
You can talk!

2437
02:24:43,549 --> 02:24:46,640
We're going to die.
Does she want us to die? ASK HER THAT!

2438
02:24:46,664 --> 02:24:49,852
No, I have a better idea.

2439
02:24:53,788 --> 02:24:57,033
Hey, Welsh! Take the knife!

2440
02:24:57,185 --> 02:25:00,085
You need something
to defend yourself with!

2441
02:25:00,903 --> 02:25:02,583
Why are you doing this?

2442
02:25:02,935 --> 02:25:05,390
JUST TAKE THE GODDAMN KNIFE!

2443
02:25:10,626 --> 02:25:12,253
Hey! Let go of my hand!

2444
02:25:12,278 --> 02:25:15,301
This is going to be painful,
but it's for your own good.

2445
02:25:20,061 --> 02:25:23,566
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

2446
02:25:25,572 --> 02:25:28,183
You killed my neighbors.

2447
02:25:28,752 --> 02:25:31,247
You killed my friends.

2448
02:25:31,759 --> 02:25:34,592
And you killed my brother.

2449
02:25:34,961 --> 02:25:37,572
This is how it feels, Welsh!

2450
02:25:37,871 --> 02:25:41,211
THIS IS HOW IT FEELS!

2451
02:25:48,495 --> 02:25:50,695
Sister, what's going on?

2452
02:25:51,172 --> 02:25:55,061
Sitho! The flying machines
are shooting at us!

2453
02:25:55,435 --> 02:25:57,483
What? From this distance?

2454
02:25:57,703 --> 02:25:59,383
I don't know what is is...

2455
02:25:59,561 --> 02:26:02,748
but it's much faster, and
much deadlier than arrows!

2456
02:26:02,939 --> 02:26:05,315
They killed Urnith and Thorna...

2457
02:26:05,469 --> 02:26:08,002
and we will be next if we don't retreat!

2458
02:26:08,372 --> 02:26:10,142
But we have to defend ourselves!

2459
02:26:10,191 --> 02:26:12,721
Brother, please! Turn back!

2460
02:26:12,767 --> 02:26:14,505
-NEVER!
-SITHOOOO!

2461
02:26:17,514 --> 02:26:20,543
SITHOOO! NO!

2462
02:26:21,306 --> 02:26:22,932
NOOOOOO!

2463
02:26:24,503 --> 02:26:27,595
I'M GOING TO MAKE THEM PAY FOR THIS!

2464
02:26:27,635 --> 02:26:31,650
I SWEAR BY MY LIFE, THEY
ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS!

2465
02:26:34,095 --> 02:26:35,713
Help! Help!

2466
02:26:36,127 --> 02:26:40,350
IT HURTS.... I'M FALLING! AAAAAARGH!

2467
02:26:50,914 --> 02:26:51,914
Oh my god...

2468
02:26:54,289 --> 02:26:56,911
so... so much... pain...

2469
02:26:58,105 --> 02:26:59,542
so much... hate...

2470
02:27:04,343 --> 02:27:06,803
What... what have I done?

2471
02:27:07,167 --> 02:27:11,773
You made sure his mind will never
be at peace again for the rest of his life.

2472
02:27:12,758 --> 02:27:15,469
I... I nearly killed him...

2473
02:27:16,602 --> 02:27:17,802
He's in pain!...

2474
02:27:18,023 --> 02:27:21,433
Oh my god, I must have
broken every bone in him...

2475
02:27:21,839 --> 02:27:24,250
I... I didn't mean to do this!

2476
02:27:24,687 --> 02:27:26,060
I'm so sorry!

2477
02:27:28,995 --> 02:27:33,272
I never realized how much grief and
hate you were carrying with you.

2478
02:27:34,323 --> 02:27:35,957
I hid it from you.

2479
02:27:36,255 --> 02:27:37,255
Why?

2480
02:27:37,918 --> 02:27:40,093
I didn't want to burden you with it.

2481
02:27:40,318 --> 02:27:42,471
And... I was ashamed.

2482
02:27:43,035 --> 02:27:46,131
I didn't want you to ever see me like that.

2483
02:27:46,182 --> 02:27:47,359
Oh Ortha...

2484
02:27:47,406 --> 02:27:49,284
Sorry to interrupt your intimate moment

2485
02:27:49,309 --> 02:27:52,334
but you do realize we're
going to die soon, don't you?

2486
02:27:52,381 --> 02:27:56,029
Can someone explain to me
what on earth is going on here?

2487
02:27:56,636 --> 02:27:58,776
I've seen you before.

2488
02:27:59,318 --> 02:28:01,118
You used to work for Welsh.

2489
02:28:01,639 --> 02:28:05,022
And you're Eva
Harrington's daughter, right?

2490
02:28:07,153 --> 02:28:09,929
And this is Ortha.

2491
02:28:10,574 --> 02:28:13,556
Ortha, bow before your Queen.

2492
02:28:21,896 --> 02:28:24,054
She does tricks?

2493
02:28:24,343 --> 02:28:27,146
What is she? Some kind of pet?

2494
02:28:28,217 --> 02:28:31,913
She is a person, and no
more an animal than we are.

2495
02:28:32,392 --> 02:28:35,464
Welsh did terrible things
to her and her people.

2496
02:28:35,988 --> 02:28:39,820
If it is like you say, why
doesn't she talk to us?

2497
02:28:40,338 --> 02:28:42,550
Oh, she'd love to.

2498
02:28:42,769 --> 02:28:44,449
All you have to do is

2499
02:28:45,201 --> 02:28:46,544
touch my paw.

2500
02:28:46,847 --> 02:28:48,719
I beg your pardon?

2501
02:28:49,601 --> 02:28:52,076
Look, I'm not armed.

2502
02:28:52,361 --> 02:28:55,533
And Cal is going to drop his gun, too.

2503
02:28:57,863 --> 02:28:58,863
Am I?

2504
02:28:58,926 --> 02:28:59,926
Absolutely.

2505
02:29:00,450 --> 02:29:01,450
All right.

2506
02:29:04,729 --> 02:29:06,803
This is not a revolt.

2507
02:29:07,156 --> 02:29:11,949
You are my Queen, and I do not
have the right to force this upon you.

2508
02:29:12,469 --> 02:29:16,571
However, I know that you are a good person.

2509
02:29:17,513 --> 02:29:20,657
Yeah, and what separates a
good person from a bad person is

2510
02:29:20,682 --> 02:29:22,607
that a good person can change

2511
02:29:22,681 --> 02:29:25,014
and they will always find new ways.

2512
02:29:25,153 --> 02:29:27,502
Decide to end our lives now

2513
02:29:27,549 --> 02:29:29,761
and everything will stay the same

2514
02:29:29,795 --> 02:29:32,343
and ignorance will prevail.

2515
02:29:32,736 --> 02:29:34,176
Choose to trust me

2516
02:29:34,392 --> 02:29:37,602
and you will learn things that
are of utmost importance for you

2517
02:29:37,627 --> 02:29:39,659
and the entirety of your kingdom

2518
02:29:39,732 --> 02:29:42,740
and many new ways will
open up for you to take.

2519
02:29:43,633 --> 02:29:46,097
The choice is yours, my Queen.

2520
02:29:56,883 --> 02:30:01,988
[applause]

2521
02:30:13,749 --> 02:30:17,141
Welcome to the evening
news on Astar National Radio!

2522
02:30:17,924 --> 02:30:22,441
Great Astar's most proficient
industry magnate Sarkan T. Welsh

2523
02:30:22,521 --> 02:30:26,681
faces a devastating new scandal
following a whistleblower report.

2524
02:30:27,019 --> 02:30:30,639
The royal house confirmed that
they are investigating evidence of fraud

2525
02:30:30,660 --> 02:30:32,660
attempted murder, blackmail

2526
02:30:32,767 --> 02:30:37,129
multiple anti-trust violations,
embezzlement and treason.

2527
02:30:37,594 --> 02:30:41,466
The Harrington & Welsh company did
not respond to our request for comments

2528
02:30:41,539 --> 02:30:44,571
but a copy of the report
was leaked to this reporter.

2529
02:30:44,770 --> 02:30:49,095
The allegations, if proven, will
forever tarnish the company's reputation

2530
02:30:49,234 --> 02:30:50,434
and its owner's

2531
02:30:51,212 --> 02:30:53,871
Evidence strongly points
towards the crucial role

2532
02:30:53,896 --> 02:30:57,137
Mr. Welsh played in the
escalation of the conflict with Vanos

2533
02:30:57,270 --> 02:31:01,494
with the sole goal to increase
his profit as an arms manufacturer.

2534
02:31:02,126 --> 02:31:04,358
A particularly explosive revelation

2535
02:31:04,445 --> 02:31:08,317
is that he might be personally responsible
for the death of Peter M. Harrington

2536
02:31:08,469 --> 02:31:11,015
aviation pioneer and national hero

2537
02:31:11,168 --> 02:31:14,624
and the attempted murder
of Eva Harrington, his wife.

2538
02:31:15,462 --> 02:31:18,013
In a statement to the
Port Ospen Telegraph

2539
02:31:18,099 --> 02:31:20,513
Eva Harrington confirmed the accusations

2540
02:31:20,533 --> 02:31:24,904
stating that she did not agree to Welsh's
acquisition of the company under her own free will

2541
02:31:24,997 --> 02:31:27,799
therefore making the
contract null and void.

2542
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:30,273
She has appealed to the
queen to award her with

2543
02:31:30,298 --> 02:31:31,977
the full ownership of the company

2544
02:31:32,024 --> 02:31:35,000
after her house was recently
destroyed by a bomb blast

2545
02:31:35,067 --> 02:31:39,289
engineered by the company under
the guise of a Vanosian terrorist attack.

2546
02:31:39,853 --> 02:31:42,539
Furthermore, the royal geographic society

2547
02:31:42,564 --> 02:31:45,954
has withdrawn their support of
the findings of Mr. Welsh's so called

2548
02:31:46,034 --> 02:31:47,834
"Trans-Oceanic Expedition".

2549
02:31:48,216 --> 02:31:49,896
After close examination

2550
02:31:49,982 --> 02:31:53,015
it is highly doubtful that the
expedition took place in the form

2551
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:55,640
the Harrington & Welsh company claimed.

2552
02:31:55,691 --> 02:31:57,730
When police searched
company headquarters

2553
02:31:57,776 --> 02:32:01,204
the fantastic "beast"
was nowhere to be found.

2554
02:32:01,403 --> 02:32:04,417
They did however find a
workshop with materials suitable

2555
02:32:04,442 --> 02:32:07,969
to build a highly sophisticated
mechanical puppet.

2556
02:32:08,578 --> 02:32:12,635
In all likelihood, the beast was nothing
more than a very realistic marionette

2557
02:32:12,781 --> 02:32:14,461
and it fooled us all.

2558
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:18,641
Whether the new continent
really exists remains to be proven

2559
02:32:18,741 --> 02:32:23,549
but the Queen has put all research
projects in that regard on indefinite hold.

2560
02:32:23,997 --> 02:32:29,320
Sarkan T. Welsh is being detained in
the high security prison in Port Ospen.

2561
02:32:29,512 --> 02:32:32,965
The Queen's medical adviser
reports that he is in poor mental health

2562
02:32:32,990 --> 02:32:35,857
and is showing signs of delusion and mania.

2563
02:32:36,294 --> 02:32:40,198
The company was put under
forced administration by the Queen.

2564
02:32:40,671 --> 02:32:44,575
This story will surely keep the
country in suspense for weeks

2565
02:32:44,796 --> 02:32:48,700
as new details of these tremendous
conspiracies are revealed.

2566
02:32:49,048 --> 02:32:53,502
As always, stay tuned for
updates from Astar National Radio!

2567
02:33:13,763 --> 02:33:16,995
One final announcement on our own accord

2568
02:33:17,552 --> 02:33:19,983
It is with great sadness
that we have to report

2569
02:33:20,007 --> 02:33:21,978
the death of our friend and colleague

2570
02:33:22,003 --> 02:33:23,683
Mr. Feivel Mc Brookhaven.

2571
02:33:24,270 --> 02:33:27,727
He died in the performance
of his duties as a field reporter

2572
02:33:27,748 --> 02:33:30,081
on the Peter M. Harrington airfield

2573
02:33:30,340 --> 02:33:33,476
struck down by the
explosion of a terrorist bomb.

2574
02:33:33,847 --> 02:33:36,499
He will always be remembered.

2575
02:33:37,219 --> 02:33:40,255
A memorial service will
be held on August 21st

2576
02:33:40,403 --> 02:33:41,403
at 2 p.m.

2577
02:33:41,771 --> 02:33:44,890
at the Memorial Church in Kempton Yard.

2578
02:33:48,756 --> 02:33:54,627
[applause]

2579
02:34:38,899 --> 02:34:40,986
Greetings, Ms. Ortha!

2580
02:34:51,015 --> 02:34:54,205
You look marvelous,
my Lady, as always!

2581
02:34:54,876 --> 02:34:56,556
So glad to see you again!

2582
02:35:01,053 --> 02:35:02,413
Hello my Darling!

2583
02:35:11,124 --> 02:35:13,124
Do you know where Florence is?

2584
02:35:13,195 --> 02:35:15,261
Is she on the airship with Cal?

2585
02:35:33,811 --> 02:35:36,322
Mom, Abe! Hello!

2586
02:35:36,786 --> 02:35:39,386
Oh, so good to see you!

2587
02:35:39,751 --> 02:35:42,351
I've just helped Cal finish up packing.

2588
02:35:42,861 --> 02:35:44,622
Hello Mr. Davis.

2589
02:35:46,247 --> 02:35:49,346
Hello Mr. French. Why suddenly so formal?

2590
02:35:49,371 --> 02:35:53,353
Oh, I'm just giving you the
respect you finally deserve.

2591
02:35:55,100 --> 02:35:56,220
No, I don't know...

2592
02:35:57,154 --> 02:35:59,988
Oh do not sell yourself short, young man.

2593
02:36:00,029 --> 02:36:03,613
You are about to leave this
continent, possibly forever.

2594
02:36:04,076 --> 02:36:06,309
You are going to be a
ground-dwelling stranger

2595
02:36:06,334 --> 02:36:08,319
in a society of airborne people

2596
02:36:08,344 --> 02:36:11,244
whose language you'll
never be able to speak.

2597
02:36:11,451 --> 02:36:13,689
That doesn't just take courage.

2598
02:36:13,714 --> 02:36:15,981
That takes ball bearings of steel.

2599
02:36:16,076 --> 02:36:18,649
So, Hats off to you, Mr. Davis.

2600
02:36:19,087 --> 02:36:21,620
It seems like nothing ever scares you!

2601
02:36:23,284 --> 02:36:26,473
Oh, I am very scared.

2602
02:36:27,714 --> 02:36:30,295
The moment the Queen
told us that society isn't ready

2603
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:32,623
for contact with another species yet

2604
02:36:33,873 --> 02:36:35,873
I knew I had to go with Ortha.

2605
02:36:36,869 --> 02:36:38,626
I love her so much

2606
02:36:39,492 --> 02:36:42,639
I'd rather be with her
than with anybody else.

2607
02:36:42,818 --> 02:36:44,258
It will be worth it.

2608
02:36:45,482 --> 02:36:48,682
How are you going to talk
to her without Florence?

2609
02:36:49,243 --> 02:36:51,994
Ortha is picking up more
and more of our language.

2610
02:36:52,318 --> 02:36:56,125
Florence has been a great help in teaching
her the basics in just a few weeks.

2611
02:36:56,721 --> 02:37:00,746
And did you know that Ortha's
people have a written language, too?

2612
02:37:01,796 --> 02:37:05,886
It's surprising that someone can
have such a sophisticated culture

2613
02:37:05,966 --> 02:37:09,179
and on the other hand still
hunt the neighbor's sheep.

2614
02:37:09,265 --> 02:37:12,714
Hah, no! No, she's a civilized person

2615
02:37:12,869 --> 02:37:15,402
she would never do that! Right, Ortha?

2616
02:37:30,835 --> 02:37:33,079
It's all right. It's all right.

2617
02:37:44,227 --> 02:37:47,640
Florence, do you want to
hear some really good news?

2618
02:37:47,727 --> 02:37:48,727
Yes, mom?

2619
02:37:49,779 --> 02:37:52,045
We received a letter this morning!

2620
02:37:52,128 --> 02:37:53,928
Welsh has been dispossessed

2621
02:37:54,036 --> 02:37:57,684
and the Queen herself signed
the company back over to us!

2622
02:37:58,241 --> 02:38:00,692
Oh, that's wonderful news!

2623
02:38:01,751 --> 02:38:03,498
And guess what's even better?

2624
02:38:03,707 --> 02:38:06,539
-Abe and I are going to get married!
-What?

2625
02:38:06,659 --> 02:38:10,111
Harrington & French, how
does that sound to you?

2626
02:38:10,386 --> 02:38:12,143
Ah, that sounds awesome!

2627
02:38:12,177 --> 02:38:14,005
Congratulations!

2628
02:38:14,060 --> 02:38:16,730
Does that mean I can
become an airplane engineer?

2629
02:38:16,760 --> 02:38:19,548
Hmm, yes. No more cake!

2630
02:38:29,604 --> 02:38:32,376
Oh, that's what you've been talking about.

2631
02:38:32,401 --> 02:38:34,866
Congratulations on your new job!

2632
02:38:35,012 --> 02:38:37,814
And my best wishes to Abe and Eva!

2633
02:38:39,003 --> 02:38:41,670
I'm so happy and so sad at the same time

2634
02:38:41,695 --> 02:38:44,496
I think my head is going to explode...

2635
02:38:45,913 --> 02:38:50,033
By the way, is there any
news about Mae and Will?

2636
02:38:50,206 --> 02:38:51,726
How are they doing?

2637
02:38:52,340 --> 02:38:55,847
Well, Will is still
walking on crutches, but

2638
02:38:56,059 --> 02:38:58,459
his leg is getting better every day.

2639
02:38:58,690 --> 02:39:00,849
Mae is struggling to keep the farm running

2640
02:39:00,874 --> 02:39:03,674
but she's getting help from a few friends.

2641
02:39:04,826 --> 02:39:05,866
I understand.

2642
02:39:06,277 --> 02:39:08,484
Please give them my best greetings.

2643
02:39:08,518 --> 02:39:09,984
They are good people.

2644
02:39:10,103 --> 02:39:12,228
I will. I promise.

2645
02:39:15,173 --> 02:39:17,124
It's time for us to go.

2646
02:39:18,917 --> 02:39:22,565
I still can't believe today is
the day you're going home.

2647
02:39:23,571 --> 02:39:25,030
You're my friend

2648
02:39:25,203 --> 02:39:28,627
and it feels like I've
known you for all my life.

2649
02:39:29,345 --> 02:39:31,025
Maybe we will come back

2650
02:39:31,397 --> 02:39:34,045
one distant day. Who knows.

2651
02:39:35,846 --> 02:39:38,822
I'm going to miss your voice in my head.

2652
02:39:39,204 --> 02:39:41,037
Oh - oh yes, me too.

2653
02:39:41,549 --> 02:39:42,549
Me too.

2654
02:39:46,100 --> 02:39:48,337
Have a safe trip home, and

2655
02:39:48,973 --> 02:39:50,907
take good care of each other.

2656
02:39:52,145 --> 02:39:53,334
Farewell my friends!

2657
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:54,741
Farewell!

2658
02:39:54,766 --> 02:39:55,956
Farewell!

2659
02:39:56,705 --> 02:39:59,437
Bye bye Cal, Bye bye Ortha!

2660
02:40:02,204 --> 02:40:03,818
Farewell Mrs. Harrington.

2661
02:40:03,843 --> 02:40:05,443
Farewell Mr. French.

2662
02:40:12,764 --> 02:40:13,764
Bye bye!

2663
02:40:14,334 --> 02:40:16,182
I will never forget you!
