1
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:58,663
Shadows, from my first breath,

2
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:05,171
hide me away from a world

3
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,683
already cold

4
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:10,798
What can it show?

5
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:14,509
Where can it go?

6
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:17,762
Tell me it's true,

7
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:21,455
that you will know

8
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,564
under all this dead naked snow

9
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:30,841
sounds come from below

10
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:33,602
Calling,

11
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:38,628
seeking...

12
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,122
Turn it all round,

13
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:43,899
Raise up the sound!

14
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:45,085
Light,

15
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,979
Light it's your time,

16
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,979
Fight all your fears

17
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:50,979
and answer our sign

18
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,145
Let's close our eyes

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,100
ancients will rise

20
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,753
Light the signal!

21
00:02:00,232 --> 00:02:01,172
Dark,

22
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:03,112
Darkness behold,

23
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,097
Blinding the truth,

24
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:07,244
For all I have known,

25
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:08,915
Yet I will walk,

26
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,975
I will run, I will fly,

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,095
I will soar, I will fight

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,538
To light the signal!

29
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:44,246
I need to break from this fate,

30
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:46,292
What the hell is at stake?

31
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,524
This is our will... 
Can it be?

32
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:51,211
So light,

33
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:55,909
Light the signal!

34
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,283
Light,

35
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,248
Light it's your time,

36
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,150
Fight all your fears

37
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,129
Answer our sign

38
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:37,108
Let's close our eyes

39
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,228
ancients will rise

40
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:43,315
Light the signal!

41
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:45,230
Dark,

42
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:47,275
Darkness behold,

43
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,937
Blinding the truth,

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,245
For all I have known,

45
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,955
Yet I will walk,

46
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,640
I will run, I will fly,

47
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,680
I will soar, I will fight

48
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,266
To light the signal!

49
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:06,593
Woooooooooo!

50
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:11,315
Wooooooaaaaaaa!

51
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,070
I will walk,

52
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,627
I will run, I will fly

53
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:16,919
I will soar, I will fight...

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,660
To light the signal.
