1
00:00:28,983 --> 00:00:30,856
Spiraling down,

2
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:34,656
tryna go around and around

3
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,903
And it's better not to fall off the edge

4
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:45,035
Spinning as a coin,

5
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:48,452
down an endless road

6
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:51,087
Where can I go,

7
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:55,388
the center it flows

8
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:59,657
Do I put my trust

9
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:02,678
in a faith thatâ€™s new?

10
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,925
Does no one really listen,

11
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,042
except for you?

12
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,995
Except for you?

13
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:19,518
What's this light

14
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:22,363
that draws me near?

15
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:24,924
A keeper,

16
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:29,954
or something more to fear?

17
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:36,023
How can I put my faith in you

18
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:39,370
Your words are strong,

19
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,060
does that make them true?

20
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:46,963
I reach far out,

21
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:50,590
for one to hold

22
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:53,673
To give one strum,

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,193
so I'm undone

24
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,387
I can't do this alone,

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,032
I need someone

26
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:09,297
To take my soul and fears

27
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:15,684
The wound that will not heal

28
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:23,264
Feed me my own pain

29
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:29,650
I'll never be the same

30
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:36,845
To take my soul and fears

31
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:44,096
A wound that will not heal

32
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:50,530
Feed me my own pain

33
00:02:50,555 --> 00:03:00,475
I'll never be the same

34
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:17,564
My faith is you!

35
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:25,950
My faith is you!

36
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:35,040
So take my soul and feel

37
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:42,439
The wound that will not heal

38
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:48,639
Feed me my own pain

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,322
So I'll never,

40
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:56,056
ever be the same.
