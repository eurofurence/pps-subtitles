1
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,440
Lonely.

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,580
I feel so lonely.

3
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,350
Days, years, centuries.

4
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,960
I've been waiting for so long ...

5
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,510
that time has become indifferent to me

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,700
All that still warms my heart ...

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,820
are memories of days that long passed.

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,730
The days when I used to bring
joy and happiness to the world

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,650
Why do they no longer call me?

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,870
Do they no longer need me?

11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,550
Do they no longer want me?

12
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,110
What a cold, cruel place
the world must have become.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,160
What new age is dawning ...

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,030
now the age of song
seems to have ended?

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,790
Is this my end?

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,590
Lonely.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,700
I feel so lonely.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,970
I want to sing!
I want to dance!

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,300
I want to ... no!
I must be free!

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,800
Oh, mortals!

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,370
Unlock the gate and let me free!

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,840
Please!

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,930
Don't let me be forgotten!

24
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,000
Is everyone ready?
Does everybody have a drink?

25
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,720
- Yes!
- Sure!

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,850
Switch the lights off!
Switch the lights off!

27
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,980
- Wait, is the CD in the player?
- Way ahead of you!

28
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,610
Quick, quick!

29
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,900
He could be here any minute!

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,940
Where is the Mountain Dew?

31
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,220
It's in the fridge.

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,270
Shh! Shh! I think he's coming!

33
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,490
- How old is he getting anyway?
- Shh! Quiet!

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,150
Hello? Hello?

35
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,970
Is anybody home?

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,620
Why are the lights out?

37
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,400
Ouch! Uh! What the ...?
Who left this ... Uh ...

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,380
What was this?

39
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,690
Happy Birthday to you!

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,540
Happy Birthday to you!

41
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,940
Happy Birthday, dear Lionel!

42
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,410
Happy Birthday to you!

43
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,740
Happy Birthday, Lionel!

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,290
Wow!

45
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,570
Wow, you guys are throwing a
surprise party! Just for me?

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,550
Aww ... you shouldn't have.

47
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,230
I don't know what to say, I ... I ...

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,630
Congratulations, Lionel!

49
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,550
Thank you!

50
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,360
Yeah, congratulations!

51
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,230
Thank you!

52
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,370
Thank you very much!

53
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,090
Who arranged all this?

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,690
Oh, it was Lori's idea.

55
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,730
I hope you like it.

56
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,790
Yes, Lori, it's wonderful!

57
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,160
But where is Poke?

58
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,620
Did he forget my birthday again?

59
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,140
Oh, this is a party.
Of course he's going to come!

60
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,890
He said he's going to be
a little late, though.

61
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,480
Ah, okay.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,550
So, who wants to have some fun?

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,550
Yeah!

64
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,540
Hey, turn the music down, please!
I got a phone call!

65
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,830
Uh, guys? This could be important!
Please!

66
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
Hello?

67
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,660
Yes?

68
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,660
Yes, that's me!

69
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,530
What?

70
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,470
Do you ... I ...

71
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,190
Oh, shit!

72
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,110
Yes, yes, I understand.

73
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,510
Where?

74
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,420
The museum of - what?

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,640
I'm sorry, I'm still a bit ...

76
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,550
Can I call you back?

77
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,710
Thank you.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,370
Yes, I'll see into it. Goodbye!

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,800
Lionel ... what's up with you?

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,850
Yes. Yes, you sound like,

81
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,680
there's something wrong.

82
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,400
Yes, Lori. Actually there is.

83
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,910
I've just been informed that my ...

84
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,150
father has passed away last night.

85
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,160
Oh Lionel! I'm so sorry!

86
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,970
If ... If there's anything I can do ...

87
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,730
N-No. No thank you. Thank you.

88
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,010
It's alright.

89
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,870
It just took me a bit by surprise.
Don't worry.

90
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,150
Lionel ... I don't know what to say.
I'm so sorry! I ...

91
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,980
Happy Birthday to you!

92
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,970
Happy Birthday to you!

93
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,990
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to you!

94
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,880
Hey!

95
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,810
Lionel! You da man!

96
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,840
One year more and you still
look beau-ti-ful!

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,030
Look!
I just stole those flowers for you!

98
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,020
Poke! Poke, shut up!

99
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,490
Oh, Lori! What's up with you?

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,070
This is his birthday party,
not a funeral, you know?

101
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,530
Par-ty!

102
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,370
I know this whole concept is
new to you, but ...

103
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,800
Oh, cut it out!

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,180
Alright. What's wrong?

105
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,440
Lionel's father is dead.

106
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,760
What do you mean, "dead"?

107
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,090
When did that happen? And how?

108
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,020
I just got a phone call.

109
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,550
He passed away in his sleep last night.

110
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,080
I'm sorry folks. The party is over.

111
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,720
Thank you all for coming but ...

112
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,180
I think Lionel wants to be alone now.

113
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,070
Aww ...

114
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,280
- Bye! -Bye!
- See you guys!

115
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,290
So ...

116
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,390
So ...

117
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,410
So the old fart has
finally hit the bucket!

118
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,200
But life goes on!

119
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,780
It's still my birthday.

120
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,100
and I'd really like to celebrate
with you guys and ...

121
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,930
Oh, dear.

122
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,900
I should have kept my mouth shut,
shouldn't I?

123
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,110
Lionel, I'm shocked!

124
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,090
Why are you talking about him
like that?

125
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,440
Yes! You almost sound like
you don't care he's dead.

126
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,090
No, it's not that it's just ...

127
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,060
Frankly, I don't miss him that much.

128
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,670
I haven't heard anything from him ...

129
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,100
since he left more than ten years ago.

130
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,040
But he's family!

131
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,300
What's been going on
between you and him?

132
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,850
Nothing! That's exactly the problem!

133
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,680
Nothing has been going on.

134
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,550
He decided to leave me behind ...

135
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,780
and chase his stupid fantasies instead.

136
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,720
And I had to find a place
to live for myself.

137
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,890
And believe me, that wasn't easy ...

138
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,680
since he didn't leave me any money.

139
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,410
And everything else he owned, he sold!

140
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,660
That's hard to believe.

141
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,150
Yes. Uh, why did he go?

142
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,110
I don't know ...

143
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,690
He told me I would understand
some day but...

144
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,060
that day hasn't come yet.

145
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,660
And now that he's dead
it's probably too late.

146
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,910
I could have been the son of a
famous musician but ... No!

147
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,300
He prefered digging in the dirt instead!

148
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,190
In the dirt?

149
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,660
A musician?

150
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,400
What was your father's job?

151
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,240
He was a singer and a songwriter.

152
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,120
And he was doing really well!

153
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,490
I swear, he was that close
to his breakthrough!

154
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,890
His songs were playing on all stations!

155
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,470
He was just about to sign
the big contract ...

156
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,680
And then he quit!

157
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,720
He decided to become ...

158
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,280
an archaeologist!

159
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,570
Got that? An archaeologist!

160
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,320
That must have been the
single most stupid decision ...

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,470
ever made on earth!

162
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,670
He threw away a perfect carrer
out of pure selfishness!

163
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,860
He didn't care the slightest bit
about the consequences ...

164
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,690
I had to face!

165
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,990
And what are you supposed to do now?

166
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,810
They want me to come to Cairo
to accept my heritage.

167
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,970
For some reason my father insisted ...

168
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,690
that I have to go and
pick it up in person.

169
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,480
But I'm not sure I really want to.

170
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,920
I mean, what could a guy like him
leave me anyway?

171
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,070
A bucket of sand and a shovel?

172
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,790
Why Cairo?

173
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,620
Because, obviously that was the place
where he used to live.

174
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,880
He was working for the
"Museum of Forgotten Arts".

175
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,640
Whatever that might be.

176
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,480
I've never heard about this
institution before ...

177
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,700
but ist sure sounds like Dad.

178
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
No matter what you think of him ...

179
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,910
You've got to pay your last
respect to him.

180
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,540
You can't just dismiss him like that.

181
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,060
This wouldn't make you
any better than him.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,740
And maybe it is worth the effort.

183
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,790
I mean, they wouldn't make you
show up personally ...

184
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,100
if it wan't important, don't you think?

185
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,600
Yes! We're going to Cairo!

186
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,050
We're going to
walk like an Egyptian!

187
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,940
Walk like an Egyptian!

188
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,770
Walk like an Egyptian!

189
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,630
Wait wait! Wait a minute!
Who said, "we"?

190
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,010
I said, "we". I mean,
we ought to stick together, right?

191
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,380
And I can't wait to meet the bit- uh,

192
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,160
see the lovely beaches, you know ...

193
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,590
sand ... and the like ...

194
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,450
Poke ...

195
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,860
There is no beach in Cairo.

196
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,990
I always wanted to see the
"Museum of Forgotten Arts".

197
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,270
Oh Lori, five minutes ago you didn't
even know this museum existed!

198
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,980
Don't you get it?

199
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,720
We're your friends, and we just
want to be with you.

200
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,910
Oh Mika, that's so sweet.

201
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,150
Alright.

202
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,180
I guess I don't have another
choice then.

203
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,270
But, guys, please keep in mind ...

204
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,400
that this is not a vacation.
We've got serious business to do.

205
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,750
Let's get packing.

206
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,410
Walk like an Egyptian!

207
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,290
Walk like an Egyptian!

208
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,260
Walk like an Egyptian!

209
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,390
Walk like an Egyptian!

210
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,150
My Producer!

211
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,980
My Producer!

212
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,020
You called for me?

213
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,900
Yes!

214
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,420
The meeting is due!

215
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,080
Send in the
Digital Rights Managers!

216
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,130
Ja, my Producer!

217
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,790
At once!

218
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,590
Of course, my Producer!

219
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,560
I'll get them for you,
my Producer!

220
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,490
At your service, oh mighty Producer!

221
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,270
Very well!

222
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,770
Gentlemen, I have called you
to this special meeting ...

223
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,820
because I'm deeply disappointed!

224
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,280
I have just read the latest
sales report.

225
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,940
Our profit has increased by
fifty percent ...

226
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,580
and this is way below the
expectations for this quarter.

227
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,370
I find this lack of growth ...

228
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,050
disturbing.

229
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,220
How do you expect me to explain
this to our shareholders?

230
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,710
My Producer ...

231
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,230
we ... perhaps ...well ...

232
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,210
We are still doing a lot of
research in this field ...

233
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,930
and it seems, people have become
strangely inspired lately.

234
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,350
Strangely inspired, you say ...

235
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,860
That's hard to believe.

236
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,000
What do you have to
back up your claim?

237
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,310
My numbers indicate that
a lot of people are singing ...

238
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,210
unlicenced material under the shower!

239
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,260
And I just received a report
of incidences of children ...

240
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,060
in kindergartens being taught
public domain nursery songs.

241
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,460
Officially! By their teachers!

242
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,940
Imagine that!

243
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,100
Tsk ... Disgusting! What's next?

244
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,470
Teachers giving away mp3 files
in their classrooms?

245
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,890
Don't you dare speak the
forbidden word!

246
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,640
Which one? "mp3"?

247
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,130
Idiot!

248
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,710
Don't say this again! You know what
the punishment is!

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,680
Ja, my Producer!

250
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,100
I thought that rule excludes
members of the corporation.

251
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,850
Silence, you fool!

252
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,310
What was I about to say?
Ah, yes!

253
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,360
It seems that the power of inspiration
is on the rise again.

254
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,580
This development has always been
my deepest concern.

255
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,690
All sources of inspiration are
under our control.

256
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,080
I don't understand how this can be.

257
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,350
Something must have happened.

258
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,000
Perhaps the rumors are true.

259
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,450
But no matter what,

260
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,120
we must take action. Quickly.

261
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,810
Firstly, about the people
singing under the shower.

262
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,850
Call our legal department.

263
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,060
We must exert our influence in
establishing new international ...

264
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,240
copyright laws that will allow us to
demand compensation ...

265
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,410
from the manufacturers of
bathroom equipment!

266
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,980
Brilliant idea, my Producer!

267
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,350
Then, about the children.

268
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,520
We must increase our presence
in schools and kindergartens ...

269
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,730
teaching them that singing
public domain songs ...

270
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,520
means depriving hard working
artists ...

271
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,580
from their God-given right to profit!

272
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,760
We must educate them that
licencing is good ...

273
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,100
and sharing is evil.

274
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,850
As you command, my Producer!

275
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,960
Okay ... Now what are we going
to do with you?

276
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,810
What are you suggesting in order
to redeem yourself?

277
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,770
I ... I beg your forgiveness,
my Producer!

278
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,610
I didn't mean to cause any harm!

279
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,250
Please! Have mercy!

280
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,840
I only said "mp..." that word two times ...

281
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,440
and ... and ...

282
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,430
Yes. And?

283
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,150
And I promise, I will never
say "mp3" again!

284
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,720
Okay, that's enough! Three times!

285
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,020
Your behavior is intolerable!

286
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,300
- You shall receive your punishment!
- No!

287
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,080
What is your verdict, my Producer?

288
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,610
The punishment for saying the
forbidden word is ...

289
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,280
Death!
By Britney's Spear!

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,380
No! No, not that! Please!

291
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,110
What a just decision, my Producer!

292
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,240
Britney!

293
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,390
Ja, my Producer?

294
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,140
Kill him!

295
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,940
My pleasure, my Producer!

296
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,330
Despicable!

297
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,560
Do we really sell this kind of music?

298
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,420
Yes, we do. And actually it's
quite successful!

299
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,920
I even got it as mp... uh ...

300
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,160
I mean, Windows Media, yes,
Windows Media.

301
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,670
My Producer! My Producer!

302
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,570
We have tapped into a phone call ...

303
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,420
from the "Museum of Forgotten Arts"
in Egypt.

304
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,140
We finally have the proof
that your theory is true.

305
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,760
The document really exists ...

306
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,160
and the old Lion's son is already on
his way to claim his heritage.

307
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,420
Right on cue!

308
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,110
So ... Mr. Scruffycat senior
really found it!

309
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,800
Remarkable.

310
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,060
And now he's trying to pass it on
to his son.

311
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,030
I always knew he couldn't keep
a secret to himself.

312
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,220
Too bad for him. Good for us, though.

313
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,700
Send two of our best men to Cairo
and get it before he does!

314
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,150
It's the key to gaining control over
all music on this planet!

315
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,670
And we must not miss this opportunity!

316
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,760
Ja, my Producer!

317
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,730
Christopher Scruffycat!

318
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,330
You have tried to cross my plans
so many times ...

319
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,890
but not tis time!

320
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,240
When all this is over I'll be
the richest man in the world!

321
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,270
Thank you, old Lion.

322
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,920
I wouldn't have made it without you!

323
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,350
Salaam Alaykum!

324
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,840
Welcome to the "Museum of
Forgotten Arts" my honored friends.

325
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,420
My name is Yussef Al-Kali.
I have been waiting for you.

326
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,640
Alaykum Salaam.

327
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,710
Hi dude! Al-Kali?

328
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,560
Aren't you that guy who invented
the Energizer Bunny?

329
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,260
I mean last time I put the
batteries in backwards ...

330
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,720
and it kept coming, and coming,
and coming ...

331
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,890
Poke! That's not the way to
greet a man like him!

332
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,210
Let me show you how it's done.

333
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,880
Alaykum Salaam, Yussef Al-Kali!
My name is Loreena McFolkmanis ...

334
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,690
and my friends and I thank you
for your warm welcome.

335
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,910
You are equally welcome!

336
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,670
Why don't you and your friends
come over and sit down with me?

337
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,130
It's the customs of my people
to offer guests a nice cup of ...

338
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,720
arabian mocha as a gesture
of hospitality.

339
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,150
Ah, coffee! Just what I need right now!

340
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,480
Gimme that!

341
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,580
Poke, be careful! This is real
arabian mocha!

342
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,940
Yes, and it's inside the smallest cup
I've ever seen.

343
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,740
No challenge for me. Starbuck's is
my middle name!

344
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,040
Yeah! That's the real stuff!

345
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,220
Keeps your heart beating
and your paws black!

346
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,430
Uh oh ... I never tried this before.

347
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,060
I wouldn't touch it if I were you.

348
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,840
This is not the decaf, fat-free,
low-carb dish water you always sip on!

349
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,940
This is for real men, not for
little girls like you.

350
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,330
Hey, calm down macho-man! We're
tough girls, we can handle this!

351
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,270
And we don't want to be impolite,
do we, Lori?

352
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,210
Uh ... I guess ... no.

353
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,340
Maybe it's not so bad.

354
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,500
Hey ... Hey, that's really nice!
I ... I could really ...

355
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,570
Anybody else want some mocha?

356
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,570
- No!
- No!

357
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:07,250
Two cubes of sugar, please!

358
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,450
All right. I'm sure you're curious
why you had to come here in person ...

359
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,390
and what your father might
have left you.

360
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,280
The passing of your father has been
a great loss to all of us.

361
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,290
He did great things for the museum
and found many artifacts ...

362
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,920
that were believed to be
lost for centuries.

363
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,610
He devoted his life to scientific
research, but unfortunately...

364
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,100
Allah did not bless him
with the success he strived for.

365
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,670
I used to be a good friend of him,
and he asked me to give you this.

366
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,340
This is his personal diary
and research journal.

367
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,240
He told us that it contains
all his knowledge and findings.

368
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,460
However, we couldn't make any
sense of it.

369
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,440
Your father went a very long way
to make sure...

370
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,950
that it would be handed over
to you personally ...

371
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,980
and that it may never get
into the wrong hands.

372
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:10,970
And here it is. He titled it: "Finding
my Way to the Temple of Dunnowhat."

373
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,360
Indeed, this doesn't make any sense
to me either.

374
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,770
Is this book all he left me?

375
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,150
No, I have two more items for you.

376
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,690
Let me guess ... A bucket of
sand and a shovel?

377
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,720
No. He left you two things that
were very dear to him.

378
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,160
You should cherish them.
He never left home without them.

379
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,810
A whip and a hat?

380
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,730
Thank you, Daddy.

381
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,610
Shh! Shh! No licenced music
in the halls of the museum!

382
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,720
Okaaaay ...

383
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,130
What is this museum about, anyway?

384
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,690
The exhibits in this museum are the
forgotten songs of the old ages.

385
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,100
There was a time when music was
not produced by producers ...

386
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,860
and consumed by consumers.

387
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,590
Music was in the heart of everyone.

388
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,580
People would come together and
sing and dance ...

389
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,090
and share their songs.

390
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,700
Music was a part of our
everyday lives ...

391
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,600
and there used to be songs
for every occasion.

392
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,350
Those must have been wonderful times.

393
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,670
Nowadays, songs have become
intellectual property ...

394
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,260
turning open hearts into greedy minds.

395
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,860
And what has once been an
inspiration for everyone ...

396
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,620
has now become a means to fill the
pockets of just a few.

397
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,500
This museum preserves what is left
of the songs of the old ages.

398
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,060
Oh! Oh, can we hear one of them?

399
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,670
Sure! Follow me.

400
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,700
What a beautiful melody.

401
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,810
I've never heard that melody before.

402
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,470
See? That's why we are
preserving them.

403
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,740
There is a wealth of old songs
that are very beautifiul ...

404
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,410
but nobody knows about anymore
today.

405
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,650
Really?

406
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,610
And each of these boxes
holds one of the forgotten songs?

407
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,340
Oh, this is so exciting! I can't wait
to hear all of them!

408
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,860
What is inside this one?

409
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,980
No! No! Don't touch that one! No!

410
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,370
Do not open this box again!

411
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,070
This is our collection of
spare vocals.

412
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,450
We need them for
restauration purposes.

413
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,170
Sometimes we find songs
that are not in good shape ...

414
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,670
and then we use these for replacement.

415
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,700
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

416
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,670
May I open this one?

417
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,060
Sure!

418
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,480
Ooooh!

419
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,850
Aaaah!

420
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,090
Hey, wait a minute!

421
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,850
That's just a box with a light in it.

422
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,850
Oh, my mistake!

423
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,000
Well, as you can see...

424
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,540
there is no way to make big money
with all this old stuff.

425
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,540
And exactly that is the reason...

426
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,180
why we are a thorn in the side...

427
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,540
of the international media
corporations.

428
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,910
We are under their strict supervision.

429
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,860
One wrong note and this place will
be swarming with their minions.

430
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,940
Poke!

431
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,710
Poke, please! Poke!

432
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,080
Are you crazy?

433
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,280
Look, they're watching us!

434
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh no! They are coming!

435
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,450
This is the THX! Sound check!

436
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,290
You are Dolby surrounded!

437
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,310
Open the door!

438
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,880
Ah, there you are!

439
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,920
You've got something
that belongs to us!

440
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,390
You've got the choice!

441
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,660
Hand over the diary or ...

442
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,780
certain death!

443
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,510
You've got five seconds!

444
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,430
Uh, the diary?

445
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,240
Uh, well here! Take it!
I don't need it.

446
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,430
No, no!

447
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,130
No! Don't you dare come any closer!

448
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,840
You shall not have it!

449
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,980
- But ... but ... Mika ...
- No! No, Lionel!

450
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,590
You can't give it to them!

451
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,170
We went all the way to Egypt
to get this book!

452
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,280
And five minutes later
the thought police turns up ...

453
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,750
and wants to take it away?

454
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,800
Don't you smell anything fishy?

455
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,840
Alright! You've had your chance!

456
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,960
Now, prepare to die!

457
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,030
Attack!

458
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,670
Take the diary and run!

459
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,470
I'll hold them back! Run! Run!

460
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,900
No Mika! Mika! It's not worth it!

461
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,840
Stop talking! Just run!

462
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,820
I've seen this coming ... Follow me!

463
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,710
I know a secret way out of here!

464
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,150
Ah, there we are.

465
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
Finally!

466
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,710
We must have been walking for hours.

467
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,420
I thought I would never see
the light of another day.

468
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,700
Uh, day?

469
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,710
You mean night, sweetie-pie.
It's full moon!

470
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,550
Oh no! Full moon?

471
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,720
And ... And look!

472
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,090
This is a graveyard!

473
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,880
Have you never heard the stories ...

474
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,520
about what can happen
on a graveyard ...

475
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,650
under a full moon?

476
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,720
There migt be vampires!

477
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,810
Werewolves!

478
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,490
Zombies!

479
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,150
Or other unthinkable creatures
creeping out of their graves ...

480
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,740
just waiting for innocent victims
walking by!

481
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,460
Yeah! The full moon always
makes me horny, too.

482
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,990
Why is it that you innocent guys
always get the good stuff?

483
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,550
I wanna be a victim, too!

484
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,380
Lori! When will you finally grow up?

485
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,520
Vampires and Werewolves and all the
other unthinkable creatures ...

486
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,580
are just a figment of your imagination.

487
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,080
They don't exist.

488
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,500
Just like Santa Claus
or the Easter Bunny.

489
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,400
What?

490
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,790
There is no Easter Bunny?

491
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,230
No Santa?

492
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,400
But then ...

493
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,900
Who brings the presents
and hides the eggs?

494
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,540
Lori ... you still believe in ...

495
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,670
I don't know what to-

496
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,140
Ha! Haha! Got ya! Got ya!

497
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,830
Come on, admit it! Admit it!

498
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,320
You really thought I still believed
in Santa Claus, didn't you?

499
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,700
Didn't you?

500
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,410
Yeah, yeah. You really got me there.

501
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,340
I must admit ...

502
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,800
I wouldn't have been surprised
if it had been true.

503
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,790
See? I'm more grown-up
than you think!

504
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,830
As Mika said, we are tough girls,
we can handle this.

505
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,840
Right, Mika?

506
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,270
Uh ... Mika?

507
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,460
Mika?

508
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,980
Oh no! No, Mika is gone!

509
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,400
Where is she? Where is she?

510
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,370
She got eaten by the werevolves!

511
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,420
Lionel!

512
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,790
Do something!

513
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,980
She ... she could be dead!

514
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,860
Or worse!

515
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,040
Ah, there you are.

516
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,150
Look! She's back from the dead!

517
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,490
The vampires have turned her into a zombie!

518
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,450
We're all gonna die!

519
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,780
Lori? What are you talking about?

520
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,070
I'm sorry it took me so long ...

521
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,970
but I had to get the THX police guys
acquainted with the three tenors ...

522
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,280
before I could join you.

523
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,100
Oh, I'm so glad you made it!

524
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,910
We were worried about you.

525
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,430
No need to worry.

526
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,480
Having the black belt in cat-fighting
must be good for something.

527
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,990
Thank you so much.

528
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,730
We wouldn't have made it
without your help.

529
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,000
Ah, don't mention it.

530
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,990
Are you sure she's not
a zombie or something?

531
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,090
Ah, come on! Get a grip!

532
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,020
Will you stop pushing me around?

533
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,840
Lori, calm down, please!

534
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,110
I am calm! I am perfectly calm!

535
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,020
Do you know how it feels to be the
youngest member of the party?

536
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,920
Always been picked on
and pushed around ...

537
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,480
never taken seriously!

538
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,170
And nobody seems to care at all,
what I have to say ...

539
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:14,680
Lori!

540
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,260
- when it comes to ...
- Lori!

541
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,120
What?

542
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,700
Thank you, Poke!

543
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,000
Was about time!

544
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,550
I think, we'll be safe here for a while.

545
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,430
This graveyard is not known
to the common people.

546
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,520
Lionel? Do you still have the diary?

547
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,930
Because now I'm really curious
about your father's notes.

548
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,200
If there are so many people
trying so hard to get it ...

549
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,440
and your father making such a
fuss about its secrecy ...

550
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,360
it must be very very important.

551
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,300
Alright.

552
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,280
Alright, then. I would suggest we go
through it together, line by line.

553
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,690
Okay.

554
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,660
So, it's titled:

555
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,300
"Finding my way to the
Temple of Dunnowhat."

556
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,780
Whatever the
"Temple of Dunnowhat" might be,

557
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,030
it seems to be a place of
utmost importance ...

558
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,520
and this book is probably the
key to finding it.

559
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,590
This is what it says
on the first page:

560
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:25,680
"The politician's daughter
was accused of drinking water."

561
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:30,340
"No tea or tomato juice.
You'll see no potato juice."

562
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:31,590
What?

563
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,850
Wait, wait ... Let me continue reading.

564
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:47,310
"You can't get cherry soda,
because they got to fill that quota."

565
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:53,060
"And when ham and eggs need savor,
coffee ketchup gives them flavor."

566
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,280
This is total bullshit!

567
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,360
Then it goes on like this:

568
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,570
"This is the rock that rolls,
not moving too fast or too slow."

569
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,320
"This is the rock that rolls,
as soon as it hits you, you'll know."

570
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,250
That's even worse.

571
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,500
Yes, we were equally confused
when we got to that part.

572
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,400
Lori ...

573
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,270
What's the matter?

574
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,670
Lori, forget it! If you refuse to calm
down, that muzzle will stay on!

575
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,590
Now stop whining and let us
do our work, okay?

576
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,970
Okay.

577
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,080
"All the happy saints go marching in."

578
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,040
"And if one of those saints steps out
of line, he'll have to start again."

579
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,350
I don't know what your Dad
has been smoking, but ...

580
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,750
I want some of that shit.

581
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,450
"Jacobs golden ladder
gets slippery at the top."

582
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,850
"And many-a happy-go-lucky saint
has made that long long drop."

583
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,020
I really wonder what this is all about.

584
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,270
Lori ...

585
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,330
This is really strange, here ...

586
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,520
Lori, one last time, stay put!

587
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,680
There are no monsters, there are
no vampires,

588
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,500
werewolves or zombies. Okay?

589
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,450
And we have serious business
to do here.

590
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,810
Do you understand?

591
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,460
Oh, I have no idea
what has gotten into her.

592
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,370
Maybe it's the full moon.

593
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,600
Nah, I bet nobody ever got
into her, anyway.

594
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,110
Okay, let's continue.

595
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,050
"A giant vision in the distance,
chase that rainbow down."

596
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,700
"I hear a pound pound
pounding in my chest ..."

597
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,630
"I hear a knock knock
knocking sound."

598
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,370
"Knock knock knocking
on heaven's door."

599
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,860
"The trees speak to me,
and I listen to them carefully."

600
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,510
"Whether standing still or
blowing in the wind,

601
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,050
I hear them singing."

602
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,700
"The trees speak, they whisper
a sweet melody."

603
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,180
"The keepers of more wisdom
than you and I."

604
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,660
"So listen to them carefully."

605
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,920
Alright.

606
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,110
Okay. We have read through the
first four pages.

607
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,260
And you know what?

608
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:39,350
I didn't understand a single word!

609
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,700
Lionel, are you sure your Dad ...

610
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,780
still had his wits together?

611
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,690
I'm not so sure anymore.

612
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,360
Hey, guys? You noticed anything?

613
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,810
No, what do you mean?

614
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,940
Lori has stopped whining.

615
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,560
Hey, now that you mention it ...

616
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,850
Oh, was about time!

617
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,790
Sooo ...

618
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,080
You can be quiet after all.

619
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,810
See? It wasn't that hard, was it?

620
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,280
Come on, let me remove this.

621
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,890
Okay guys, we have no choice.

622
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,360
We'll have to go through it again.

623
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,320
Let's see if there's something
we've been missing.

624
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,050
There must be a meaning to this.

625
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,510
You know ...

626
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,630
The reasons of my father might be
hard to understand, but ...

627
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,450
I'm quite sure he wasn't crazy.

628
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,250
This must be some kind of code.

629
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,520
"The politician's daughter
was accused of drinking water."

630
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,430
Hey! Hey, I know that line!

631
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,320
- Really?
- What?

632
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:54,090
Yes, I tried to tell you guys,
but you wouldn't let me!

633
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:55,930
Okay ...

634
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,110
Well ...

635
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:02,010
You know Lori, it does sound
vaguely familiar to me but ...

636
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,980
I can't really remember
where I first heard it.

637
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,230
So, where is it from?

638
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,140
It's an old song done by
Frank Sinatra.

639
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,070
It's the "Coffee Song".

640
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,580
And it goes like this.

641
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,580
"Way down among Brazilians
coffee beans grow by the billions."

642
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,790
"So they've got to find
Those extra cups to fill."

643
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:37,030
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil"

644
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,770
"You can't get cherry soda
Cause they've got to fill that quota."

645
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,060
"And the way things are I bet
They never will."

646
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:49,050
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

647
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,360
"No tea or tomato juice."

648
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,320
"You'll see no potato juice."

649
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,820
"And all the farmers in Africa say:"

650
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,310
"Hey! Hey! Hey!"

651
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:06,070
"The politicians daughter
Was accused of drinking water."

652
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,450
"And was fined a great big
Fifty Dollar bill."

653
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,610
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

654
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,640
"No tea or tomato juice."

655
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,690
"You'll see no tomato juice."

656
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,610
"And all the farmers in Africa say:"

657
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,700
"Hey! Hey! Hey!"

658
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,890
"And when their ham and
eggs need savor,"

659
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,950
"Coffee ketchup gives them flavor."

660
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,660
"Coffee pickles way outsell the dill."

661
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,880
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

662
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,930
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

663
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,760
"In Brazil!"

664
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,040
"In Brazil!"

665
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,790
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

666
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,610
"In Brazil!"

667
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,730
"In Brazil!"

668
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,370
Brazil!

669
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,870
Brazil!

670
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,240
- Brazil!
- Brazil!

671
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,600
Lori! Brazil! That's it!

672
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,220
Oh, well done, Lori!

673
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,340
You solved the first part
of the puzzle!

674
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,330
- Ooookay.
- Did I?

675
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,430
So we have to go to Brazil.

676
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,060
But, Brazil is a big country.

677
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,750
We need to figure out
where exactly we need to go.

678
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,190
Does anybody know the names of the
most important cities in Brazil?

679
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,380
Sure! There are: Brazilia, São Paulo,

680
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,190
Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Natal,

681
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,840
- Salvador, São Felix ...
- Uh, stop, stop, stop!

682
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,460
What was the last one again?

683
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,770
São Felix?

684
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,680
São Felix loosely translates to,
"The Lucky Saint."

685
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,690
Look at this line in the book:

686
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,420
"And many a-happy-go-lucky saint
has made that long long drop."

687
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,190
Well, I must say ... not bad!

688
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,640
So we need to go to São Felix
in Brazil!

689
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,220
Mmh ... São Felix.

690
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,500
A nice old town at the edge
of the brazilian rainforest.

691
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,240
And what do the other lines mean?

692
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,770
"I hear a pound pound
pounding in my chest."

693
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,620
"This is the rock that rolls,
as soon as it hits you, you'll know."

694
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,320
"The trees speak to me,
so I listen to them carefully."

695
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,320
I don't have a clue Lori but ...

696
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,030
we finally have a starting point.

697
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,920
I hope those lines will make
more sense once we get there.

698
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,660
Please accept the advice of an
experienced archaeologist.

699
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,610
Try to memorize those lines.

700
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,000
You might get separated
or lose the book.

701
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,440
So it's decided! We are going to
visit the brazilian rainforest!

702
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,940
Ah, Brazil!

703
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,860
It is such a wonderful place of
ancient history and adventure.

704
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,810
I wish I could come with you.

705
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,190
Well ...

706
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,530
If you want to ... We can use
all help we can get!

707
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,170
Yes! Why don't you join us?

708
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,770
Oh, thanks for the offer!

709
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,540
But I really can't go with you.

710
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,480
I'm an old man myself ...

711
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,050
and if I don't stay here and take
care of the museum, who will?

712
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,690
Yes, my little one, it's time
to say goodbye.

713
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,600
But before you leave,
I've got something for you.

714
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,160
Oh, what is it? What is it?

715
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,800
Here! Please accept this flask ...

716
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,450
of real arabian mocha
as my farewell gift.

717
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,210
Thank you ... very much ...
uh ... I ...

718
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,810
Hey cool! I owe you one!
That's the good stuff!

719
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,170
Thank you Yussef! That's
very kind of you.

720
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,190
But we must go now.
To the brazilian rainforest!

721
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,180
But how do we get there?

722
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,430
Just follow me! I know a secret
passage to the airport.

723
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,430
Why am I not surprised ...

724
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,720
Something is happening!

725
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,650
I don't know what it is ...

726
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,570
but I can feel it.

727
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:25,070
My urge to break free is
stronger than ever before.

728
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,650
I'm feeling restless.

729
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,350
Pacing back and forth in my confinement ...

730
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,970
like an animal in it's cage.

731
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,550
I wish I could see more clearly.

732
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,530
It feels like someone is coming!

733
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,380
Could it be possible ...

734
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,730
that the key has not been lost but ...

735
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,390
merely misplaced?

736
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,970
I can feel darkness, but ...

737
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,670
there's also light.

738
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,150
Are they coming to free me?

739
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,740
Or are they coming to kill me?

740
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,690
Let them come!

741
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,190
I may be old, but I'm not rusty.

742
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,530
Be it songs of war,
or songs of love.

743
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:05,060
Just let me sing!

744
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,590
Poke?

745
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,830
Poke.

746
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,910
- Poke!
- What?

747
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,870
During the whole flight you've been
listening to the same song ...

748
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,740
Over and over and over
and over again!

749
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,300
This is making me crazy!

750
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,980
I spent my last three bucks on the
licence to put it onto my playlist!

751
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,880
However, the licence to remove
it from the playlist would be ...

752
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,070
another five bucks!

753
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,450
But I'm broke!

754
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,170
Alright, alright!

755
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,760
For the good of society!

756
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,740
Look into your pockets.

757
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,150
Does anyone have any
spare change ...

758
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,040
so we can make this stop?

759
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,790
Okay, here we go.

760
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,420
Hello, this is your pilot speaking.

761
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,850
We are now above the brazilian
rainforest near São Felix.

762
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,290
Get ready to jump!

763
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,030
I repeat:
Get ready to jump!

764
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,470
What?

765
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,280
Get ready to ... jump?

766
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,850
Did you really believe
those straps were safety belts?

767
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,640
Well, in a way they are.

768
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,770
Don't you remember the line
from that book?

769
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,330
"And many-a happy-go-lucky saint
has made that long long drop."

770
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,950
The management of Poke Arilines
wishes you a pleasant flight!

771
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,020
Count to three and pull the cord!

772
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,110
One!

773
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,000
Two!

774
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,450
Three! Hehe!

775
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,090
Okay guys, are you ready?

776
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,270
Mika? Poke?

777
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:20,770
- Ready!
- Let's rock!

778
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,400
Oh, sweet!

779
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,070
The one single hole ...

780
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,650
in the ground of the entire
goddamn rainforest ...

781
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:56,540
and I step into it at once!

782
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,460
Great ... This is just great.

783
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,880
A new world record!

784
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,800
I chipped eight claws,
deranged my hairdo ...

785
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,800
ripped my clothes apart and
dislocated one shoulder ...

786
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,550
in less than ten seconds!

787
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,690
This is number two on the
top ten worst things ...

788
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,100
that have ever happened to me.

789
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,720
Right after number one:

790
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,910
Being hit over the head
with a tomb stone!

791
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,990
And can somebody please
cut off this thing?

792
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,920
I want to cry now ...

793
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,450
But I'm just too fed up with all this!

794
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,560
Having been kicked out of a plane ...

795
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,490
crashing into the brazilian
rainforest ...

796
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,460
and landing inside this dark cave ...

797
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,330
that has obviously no other exit ...

798
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,260
than the skylight I fell through,

799
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
which I can't reach from down here.

800
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,760
It can't possibly get any worse
than this.

801
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,530
Uh oh ...

802
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:08,900
Oh no! not this time! Not this time!

803
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,480
Stop!

804
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:25,550
This is so depressing ...

805
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,990
Thousand years of waiting
for the next adventurers ...

806
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,830
coming into my cave
to be crushed by me ...

807
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,600
And now they don't even run away
from me anymore.

808
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,050
This is so depressing.

809
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,670
You are not going to crush me?

810
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,430
Oh, I can still do it if you want to.

811
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,120
Although ...

812
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,780
It's not much fun if you
don't run away.

813
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,660
Hold still, I'll make it quick.

814
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,410
Oh! No, no no nonono!

815
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,940
I just changed my mind,
thank you very much.

816
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,310
What's your name?

817
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,190
Does it matter?

818
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,640
To me? Yes, it does.

819
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:11,650
I used to have a name ...

820
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,690
but I'm too depressed to remember.

821
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,790
What makes you so depressed?

822
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,660
Well, are you happy to be down here?

823
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,680
Uh, no. Why?

824
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,260
See what I mean?

825
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,370
They put me in this cave and told me,

826
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,620
"Watch over this glowing stone!"

827
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,860
"If anyone wants to touch it,
crush them!"

828
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,060
They made me believe that it's ...

829
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,150
an incredibly honorable task ...

830
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,000
and that I'll be richly rewarded
some day.

831
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,490
And then they said,

832
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,730
"Good bye!" ...

833
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,100
and made the entrance
of the cave collapse.

834
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,630
I feel so stupid!

835
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,950
Have you never tried ...

836
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,510
breaking through the barrier
of the cave entrance?

837
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,770
I tried that once.

838
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,040
The only thing that happened
was a loud "Crunch!"

839
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,950
And when I regained my senses
I found out ...

840
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:08,180
that several small parts had
crumbled off me.

841
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,720
Mh ... Ouch!

842
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:11,630
That must have hurt badly.

843
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,900
It did hurt.

844
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,120
But it's not the worst thing.

845
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,600
Not? What happened?

846
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,440
Papa! Papa!

847
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,380
Papa, Papa!

848
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,420
- Papa!
- Oh no ...

849
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:28,090
Not again you ...

850
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,370
"Papa is a rolling stone!"

851
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,400
"Crushing adventurers who
fall in his home."

852
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:46,790
"And when they die,"

853
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,390
"All that's left are broken bones."

854
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,700
"It was the third of September."

855
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:07,090
"This day I'll always remember."

856
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,590
"'Cause that was the day."

857
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,300
"When I realized,"

858
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,470
"I'll never have a chance to leave here."

859
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,960
"I'm dumb like a rock
still I try to break free."

860
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,110
"Children I'm depending on you,"

861
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,620
"To help me get out."

862
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,580
"But no! Instead they keep singing:"

863
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,620
"Papa is a rolling stone!"

864
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,810
"Crushing adventurers who
fall in his home."

865
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,090
"And when they die,"

866
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,250
"All that's left are broken bones."

867
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,250
"Papa is a rolling stone!"

868
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:59,450
"Crushing adventurers who
fall in his home."

869
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,580
"And when they die,"

870
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:06,010
"All that's left are broken bones."

871
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:26,830
See?

872
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,390
This is the only song they know.

873
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,330
And they've been
singing it every day ...

874
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,070
for thousands of years.

875
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,160
Man, I'm so depressed.

876
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,410
I'm going to crush you now.

877
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,100
No! No, no no no,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

878
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,880
You remind me of something
I read in a book!

879
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,160
"This is the rock that rolls,
not moving too fast or too slow."

880
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,510
"This is the rock that rolls,
as soon as it hits you, you'll know."

881
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,250
They wrote a book about me?

882
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:58,890
Yes!

883
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,590
It's the journal of the
world renowned ...

884
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,740
stonaeologist ...

885
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,790
Dr. Christopher Scruffycat.

886
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,230
You know what? You're famous!

887
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,030
That's where I know you from!

888
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,640
Oh, great!

889
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,280
So, now I'm famous.

890
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,220
But what good is that to me
if I can't even leave this place?

891
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,360
Thank you.

892
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,660
Now I'm even more depressed
than ever before.

893
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,860
But you can leave this place!

894
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,730
All you have to do is
slam through the barrier!

895
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,840
I already tried and I failed.

896
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:35,390
Hey, let me tell you something.

897
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,810
Don't let your failures define
who you are!

898
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,690
You're only a failure if you
fail to try!

899
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,770
- But I tried!
- Then try again!

900
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,250
You're a strong piece of rock ...

901
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,870
and you're made to roll!

902
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,870
Do you really think so?

903
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:54,360
Sure! I must know, I read the book!

904
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,620
You're the mightiest rock in the world!

905
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,240
Come on! Tell me you can do it!

906
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,500
Can I?

907
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,060
Come on, I know you can do it!

908
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,520
Give me an "R"!

909
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:06,660
"R"?

910
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,590
Give me an "O"!

911
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,800
- "O"!
- "Give me a "C"!

912
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,820
- "C"!
- Give me a "K"!

913
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
"K"!

914
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,580
Who are you?

915
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:18,090
I am "The Rock"!

916
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:18,960
Yes!

917
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,390
And now you're going out there ...

918
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,620
and show them!

919
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,920
- Yes!
- Nobody can stop you!

920
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,040
Go, go go!

921
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,070
- Let's roll!
- Yeah!

922
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,490
Yes! You made it! You're great!

923
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,900
- Fantastic!
- Yeah!

924
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,840
The powers of positive thinking.

925
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,510
There's some truth in the saying,

926
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,720
"Being dumb like a rock".

927
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,480
I'm free!

928
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,290
It's wonderful!

929
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:58,590
The flowers are blooming and
the birds are singing!

930
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,810
And ... and ...

931
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,240
Oh, I landed on a slope!

932
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,050
Out of the way! I can't stop!

933
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,690
It's going down!

934
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,560
No, no! Not the tree!

935
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,400
Incoming!

936
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,270
Sorry!

937
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,870
Oh no! Be careful, old lady!

938
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,150
Out of the way!

939
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:27,310
Oh no, no!
Not the guy with the fruit stand!

940
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,890
Vaffanculo! Puttano! Bastardo!
Pompino! Cabeza de mierda!

941
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,320
Melonas! Ananas! Bananas!

942
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,730
I'm sorry!

943
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:42,420
So this is the little glowing thing ...

944
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,260
the rock was supposed to protect.

945
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,170
I wonder what it might be good for.

946
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,110
And strange sounds it makes.

947
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,120
Better I take it with me.
You never know.

948
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,260
Oh look! Look!
She's taking the glowing stone!

949
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:14,480
We must crush her!

950
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:16,120
We must crush her!

951
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,310
I'll crush her!

952
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,370
One! Two! Three!

953
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,940
Pull the cord!

954
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:51,790
Nothing's happening!

955
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,070
No, Lionel! Pull it again!

956
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,290
It won't open! Help! Help!

957
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,820
Lionel?

958
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,460
Lionel!

959
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:08,750
Can you hear me?

960
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,940
Can you hear me?

961
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,350
Oh, wake up, Lionel!

962
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,860
You must wake up!

963
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,600
Oh, Lionel! Please!

964
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,900
You must not die!

965
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:19,760
Not here, not now!

966
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,760
Lionel!

967
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,490
Hello?

968
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:30,830
Where am I?

969
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,220
Is anybody here?

970
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,470
Am I dead?

971
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:49,310
Hello Lionel!

972
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,460
How do you like it down here?

973
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,220
Are you comfortable?

974
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:59,030
Because, now it's time
to think, Lionel.

975
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,980
Why did you go to Egypt?

976
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:06,050
Was it because you cared
about your father's wishes?

977
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,960
Or was it just because you hoped ...

978
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,160
your heritage would
contain more ...

979
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,740
than just a dusty book?

980
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:17,010
Were you hoping for money?

981
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,630
Gold? Treasures?

982
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,050
Would you have traveled
all the way ...

983
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,660
if you had known
what your heritage was?

984
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:27,010
Come on!

985
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,550
You can admit it, now that it's over.

986
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,130
Was it worth having one
of your best friends ...

987
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:38,170
kicked out of an airplane
at five thousand feet?

988
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,810
Think, Lionel!

989
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:43,990
Think!

990
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:45,770
But ...

991
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,620
But, I was ... I was just ...

992
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,340
Well ... uh ...

993
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,120
Let me explain, please!

994
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:56,700
Lori!

995
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,380
Lori, please! No!

996
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,370
Let me explain!

997
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,750
Poke?

998
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,520
Woo-hoo! Lionel!

999
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,300
You da man!

1000
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,540
This crash through the trees!

1001
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,060
Mar-ve-lous!

1002
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,550
Your father would have been
proud of you!

1003
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:20,590
If you had survived, that is.

1004
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,140
Hey, come on!

1005
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,000
Now that it's over nothing
matters anymore.

1006
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,510
Let's get drunk!

1007
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,620
I'd like to bring out a toast ...

1008
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,170
to the marvelous
Lionel Scruffycat.

1009
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:35,450
Getting himself killed while
foolishly attempting to make up ...

1010
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:38,870
for the failures of a lifetime
in less than a week!

1011
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,030
Cheers!

1012
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,470
Poke, Poke! No! It's not true!

1013
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,800
No ...

1014
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,740
At least ... It's only partly true.

1015
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,550
Poke ...

1016
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,870
Why does nobody listen to me?

1017
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,140
Dad?

1018
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,940
Is that you? You're alive?

1019
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,540
You didn't care for the last
ten years ...

1020
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:05,740
so why would you care now?

1021
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,340
No ... I ...

1022
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,480
Please ... Listen to me!

1023
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,330
We don't have much time.

1024
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,930
You are my son. And for me ...

1025
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,290
you have always been the most ...

1026
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:16,750
precious thing in the world.

1027
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:19,980
Leaving you alone like this
was the hardest decision ...

1028
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,580
I ever had to make.

1029
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,350
But things were at stake ...

1030
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,750
that were so important ...

1031
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,890
not just for you, but for the
entire world ...

1032
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,890
that I had no other choice!

1033
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:32,340
Please, you must trust me!

1034
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,360
It saddens me to see that you have ...

1035
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,640
stopped believing in me.

1036
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,160
But it's not too late!

1037
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,390
You must fulfill my legacy ...

1038
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,890
or otherwise the world
may be changed forever!

1039
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,410
Trust me, Lionel, because ...

1040
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:45,640
I am your father.

1041
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,590
I'm proud of you, Lionel.

1042
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,200
I always was.

1043
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,940
I love you.

1044
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,760
No, Dad Come back!

1045
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,040
Don't leave me!

1046
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:57,940
Don't leave me again ...

1047
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,160
There's so much I need to tell you
which I never did ...

1048
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,400
even if I should have.

1049
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,960
Dad ... please ...

1050
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,800
Oh, Lionel!

1051
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:17,390
Now you see where you got
yourself with logic!

1052
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,780
If only once you had
followed your heart.

1053
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,280
Now you put not only yourself ...

1054
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,860
but all of your friends in danger!

1055
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,460
And why?

1056
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,750
Because, you're a coward!

1057
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:33,330
The only reason why you never
talked to your father was ...

1058
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,760
because you were afraid to
confront yourself with him!

1059
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,980
What are you?

1060
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,160
A big, strong lion?

1061
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,360
I will tell you what you are.

1062
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:44,810
You're a sheep!

1063
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,790
Baaaah! Lionel!

1064
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,770
I bet when you were at school ...

1065
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,160
you were beaten up by the girls!

1066
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,790
Ouch!

1067
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,320
That hurt!

1068
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,190
Oh now, come on!

1069
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,290
Do you dare hitting me back?

1070
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,060
Oh, come on!
You don't dare hitting me?

1071
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:08,970
Lionel is a coward!
Lionel is a coward!

1072
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,230
Baaaah!

1073
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,210
Mika, no! Stop hitting me, please!

1074
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,260
You're just getting what
you deserve, Lionel!

1075
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,070
Sometimes the truth does hurt!

1076
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,190
Oh, come on! Fight!

1077
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,370
Fight!

1078
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:25,530
You coward!

1079
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,540
Finally learn how to fight!

1080
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:30,640
Nobody messes with Mika!

1081
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,330
No, no, no! I don't want to!

1082
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:36,890
No, please! No! Ouch!

1083
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,310
No, no! Don't hit me, please!

1084
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,660
Lionel!

1085
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,230
Lionel!

1086
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:46,840
Wake up!

1087
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,980
Please! Oh, come on, Lionel!

1088
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,570
You must not die!

1089
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,230
Lionel!

1090
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,330
We've come this far!

1091
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:57,160
You can't leave me now!

1092
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,950
Don't leave me!

1093
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,390
Oh no ...

1094
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,520
This can't be true!

1095
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,160
Oh, Lionel!

1096
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,430
I can't live without you!

1097
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,440
And there's so much I wanted
to tell you, but ...

1098
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:13,000
but I never dared.

1099
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,030
Oh, please!

1100
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,680
I never had the chance to say ...

1101
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,150
how much I love you!

1102
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:23,400
What am I going to do now?

1103
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,780
Oh, this is so terrible!

1104
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,710
- Ow!
- Lionel!

1105
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,700
Lionel! You're alive!

1106
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,020
Lionel!

1107
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,090
No! don't hit me please!
Don't hit me!

1108
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:39,440
Are you alright?

1109
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:42,120
I thought I had lost you forever.

1110
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,510
My head hurts like hell ...

1111
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:49,260
and I'm feeling kinda dizzy.

1112
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:55,230
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive!

1113
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,270
So am I.

1114
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,570
What happened?

1115
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,500
Your parachute didn't open.

1116
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,530
But the tree stopped your fall.

1117
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,380
I must have been really lucky.

1118
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,150
No broken bones, I think.

1119
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,800
Oh, Mika ...

1120
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,530
Mika, I'm feeling so miserable about
how I treated my father.

1121
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,330
Oh, come on, Lionel.

1122
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,210
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1123
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:28,390
You are paying your filnal respect
to him after all.

1124
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,660
And even risked your life for it.

1125
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:32,990
What more could a father ask for?

1126
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,820
No Mika, you don't understand.

1127
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,750
My father is dead ...

1128
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:39,820
Nothing I do today can make up ...

1129
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:41,090
for the things I didn't do ...

1130
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:42,510
for the last ten years.

1131
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,800
Don't you realize, Mika?

1132
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,060
I was the one only thinking
about himself all the time!

1133
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,080
Even coming here was just ...

1134
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,940
because of my curiosity.

1135
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,420
And I even put me and my
best friends in danger!

1136
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:57,750
Look at me!

1137
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,000
The same could have happened to you!

1138
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,020
Or Poke!

1139
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,340
Or has possibly happened to Lori!

1140
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:06,350
I don't even see them around here!

1141
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,600
Where are they?
They could be dead ...

1142
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,990
and it's all my fault!

1143
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,220
Hush ... hush, Lionel. Shhh ...

1144
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,510
Hush ... Calm down. It's alright.

1145
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,530
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1146
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:23,260
We're your friends!

1147
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,090
You didn't force us to come with you,
remember?

1148
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,210
Yes ... you're right.

1149
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,290
There, there ...

1150
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,760
You're alive, and I am alive, too.

1151
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:38,080
And I am sure the others
are doing fine as well.

1152
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,250
Aww ... Come on, don't cry.

1153
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,070
It's alright.

1154
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,840
Oh, Mika ...

1155
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:46,040
Mika, I'm so glad that you're here.

1156
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:48,070
And I am glad that you're here.

1157
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:50,830
Mika ...

1158
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:52,400
What shall I do?

1159
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,530
What shall we do?

1160
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:57,540
We've crashed into the middle
of the jungle and ...

1161
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:59,630
Now I'm all confused.

1162
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,190
Until now, I always thought I knew
what I should do ...

1163
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,570
but this time I don't have
any clue at all ...

1164
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,880
I'm so clueless!

1165
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:13,200
What - should - I - do?

1166
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:16,870
Stop hitting my trunk
with your head for a start.

1167
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,540
Who's talking?

1168
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:25,220
The one who saved your life!

1169
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:29,390
A talking tree?

1170
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,740
Excellent observation, Mr. Holmes.

1171
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,020
And don't even think of thanking me
for saving your life ...

1172
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,970
by sacrificing at least two branches ...

1173
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,820
a dozen twigs and countless leaves.

1174
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,830
This will take years to grow back.

1175
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,130
A talking tree!

1176
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:49,220
Lionel!

1177
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,930
Remember the line from the book?

1178
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:54,870
"The trees speak to me
so I listen to them carefully."

1179
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:59,740
Then we must be on the right track!

1180
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:02,500
Hey, hey tree! Do you have a name?

1181
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:04,590
And thanks for saving my life!

1182
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,610
You can call me "Mr. Tree".

1183
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,410
And you're welcome.

1184
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,910
Alright then - uh - Mr. Tree.

1185
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:17,470
It seems that we need
your help one more time.

1186
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,300
We are looking for something ...

1187
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,550
but we don't know exactly what it is.

1188
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,810
It might be a map, a hint,

1189
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,900
an artifact or something else.

1190
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:27,860
It was mentoioned in a  book ...

1191
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,070
referring to a talking tree, like you.

1192
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,870
Do you know anything that
might be of help?

1193
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:36,060
Oh, yes. How do you know?

1194
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:40,440
In fact, I am the guardian of a
very mighty artifact.

1195
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:44,260
It was given to me more than
a thousand years ago.

1196
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:45,980
What is it?

1197
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,040
I can't tell you ...

1198
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,070
unless you can prove ...

1199
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,880
that you're the ones destined
to receive it.

1200
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,370
And how are we supposed to do that?

1201
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,870
Well, if you are the ones ...

1202
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,080
you are supposed to know.

1203
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,360
Shit!

1204
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:03,380
That means we're stuck.

1205
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,440
Lionel, do you still have the diary?

1206
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,490
No, I must have lost it ...

1207
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,410
crashing into our friend, Mr. Tree.

1208
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,850
Hey! I can't concentrate like this!

1209
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:19,340
Will you the heck stop sawing!

1210
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,300
We're trying to hold a
conversation here!

1211
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:31,810
Hey you, are you crazy?

1212
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:33,290
What are you doing here?

1213
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,700
I just wanted to ask you the same thing.

1214
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,930
Can't you see?
I'm clearing the rain forest.

1215
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,740
Clearing the ...

1216
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,250
Chopping down trees, cutting wood,

1217
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,860
trimming the vegetation, you know?

1218
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:46,170
And that one is next. Number "696".

1219
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,860
Come on, people, get out of the way.
This is dangerous.

1220
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:57,360
No, you can't do this! Stop! Please!

1221
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,650
Put that thing down!

1222
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,970
Alright, who sent you here?

1223
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:05,140
Greenpeace? Robin Wood?
World Wildlife Fund?

1224
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,000
United Tree-Huggers of
Oklahoma City?

1225
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:08,830
The Concerned Parents
of Minnessota?

1226
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,950
Huh? What are you talking about?

1227
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:14,120
We're from the "Museum of
Forgotten Arts" in Cairo.

1228
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:18,850
Can't you just cut down a different
tree than this one?

1229
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,830
Well, there are lots of trees in
the rain forest ...

1230
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,650
Big ones, small ones,
old ones, young ones,

1231
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,830
some have more leaves,
some have less leaves, so ...

1232
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:28,410
For the highest wood quality we have
to be a tad more specific, you know.

1233
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,610
Ouch.

1234
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:36,390
But you can't do that! He's our friend.

1235
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,080
He saved my life!

1236
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,490
Uh ... what the ...

1237
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,840
Well, I've heard enough. Out of my way!

1238
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,850
No!

1239
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:49,450
No!

1240
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,500
No! You're not getting near this tree!

1241
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,390
Mika, I've learned something.

1242
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:59,270
There are times where logic
will not get you anywhere.

1243
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,180
We can give this guy here as many
explanations as we want ...

1244
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,100
he is not going to understand.

1245
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,950
Now listen, Panda!

1246
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,560
You can't chop down this tree ...

1247
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,040
because I have to fulfill
my father's legacy.

1248
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,460
I have denied my father long enough,
but I tell you ...

1249
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,530
I, Lionel C. Scruffycat,

1250
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,080
am proud to be the son of
Christopher Scruffycat.

1251
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,740
May he rest in peace!

1252
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,260
And I am defending this tree ...

1253
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,790
in the name of my father.

1254
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:27,890
And if you want to take it down ...

1255
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:30,440
you will have to take me down first.

1256
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,220
What? You're the son of
Christopher Scruffycat?

1257
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,020
The Christpoher Scruffycat?
The singer?

1258
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,320
You knew him?

1259
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,750
Well, not in person, but ...

1260
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,680
when I was young, I was a huge fan.

1261
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:43,840
I still own all his CDs.
He's a childhood memory.

1262
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:46,470
I always wondered what happened
to him, after he quit.

1263
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,010
Ah, okay ... Okay then ...

1264
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,370
Listen ... my father passed away
four days ago ...

1265
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:54,460
and I'm here to fulfill his last wish.

1266
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,350
I can't explain it to you, but ...

1267
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,690
This tree here is part of it.

1268
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,020
I can't let you kill it.

1269
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,300
Wow!

1270
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,310
You're going through all that trouble
just for your father's last will.

1271
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:06,710
Pretty impressive.

1272
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,160
You must have hell of a respect
for your father.

1273
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:13,740
Ouch.

1274
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,610
Well ... I do what I can.

1275
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,050
You know, I'd really love
to spare this tree but ...

1276
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,320
I have to follow my orders,
or I lose my job.

1277
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:24,920
Mh ... wait ... what number did this
tree have again?

1278
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,740
"696"?

1279
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,840
Let's have a look.

1280
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,430
Ok, look! This must be a mix-up!

1281
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,690
This tree has the number "969".

1282
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,380
And "969" is not on my list.

1283
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:51,100
Silly me! I nearly cut down
the wrong tree!

1284
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,560
Uh ... you mean ...

1285
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:56,350
Oh, I see! Thank you!

1286
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:58,420
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

1287
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,610
Have a nice day!

1288
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:14,890
Phew!

1289
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,390
That was close!

1290
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,340
Yes, it was!

1291
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:24,640
Okay, this time you saved my life.

1292
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,300
Thank you!

1293
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,770
Now I really owe you one.

1294
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:31,090
What can I do for you?

1295
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:35,270
Well, you said, you were guarding
a certain artifact ...

1296
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,120
Alright!

1297
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,590
You shall have it!

1298
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,760
Nobody wanted it for ages ...

1299
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,230
So why shouldn't I give it to you.

1300
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:02,410
What on earth is that?

1301
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,780
It's a secret artifact.

1302
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:08,380
The thing about secrets is ...

1303
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,730
that nobody's supposed
to know about them.

1304
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:16,520
It was handed to me by some
sort of high priest ...

1305
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,290
And he simply didn't tell me
what it is.

1306
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,140
So I can't tell you.

1307
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,560
I'm sorry.

1308
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:24,800
We will find out eventually.

1309
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:28,070
But, first we'll have to find
the rest of our party.

1310
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:30,240
I bid you farewell, then!

1311
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:33,000
And thank you again for
saving my life.

1312
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,260
I consider you good friends.

1313
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:38,430
I hope you will return some day.

1314
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:40,070
Goodbye, Mr. Tree!

1315
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,360
Goodbye!

1316
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,480
Come on, Mika. Let's go.

1317
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,830
United Pawcel Service!

1318
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:05,280
Package for "Tree, Mr. 696"?

1319
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:12,200
Hey, hey!

1320
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:14,010
That's for me!

1321
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,520
Uh, wait! Uh ...

1322
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:34,080
- Lori?
- Lori?

1323
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,630
Lori!

1324
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:38,590
Lori!

1325
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:42,360
- Lori! Where are you?
- Lori?

1326
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,350
Lori!

1327
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,180
- Lori?
- Lori!

1328
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,030
Lori!

1329
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:57,830
Lionel? Mika!

1330
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:01,110
Lionel! Where are you?

1331
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,950
Lionel? Mika!

1332
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,200
Lori?

1333
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:08,690
Lori?

1334
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,650
Aaah! Lionel!

1335
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:15,510
Woman! Woman! Woman! Woman!

1336
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:16,510
Mika?

1337
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,250
Mika!

1338
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,770
Lionel?

1339
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:24,970
Mika!

1340
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,780
Lionel!

1341
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:28,960
Lori?

1342
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:30,760
- Lionel?
- Lori!

1343
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:32,480
- Lionel!
- Lori!

1344
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,710
- Lionel!
- Lori!

1345
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:36,820
Lionel?

1346
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,990
- Mika?
- Lionel!

1347
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,740
Mika!

1348
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,690
- Lori!
- Mika!

1349
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,590
Poke?

1350
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:55,200
I'm iup here! Here! In the tree!

1351
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:01,060
Poke!

1352
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:03,150
What are you doing up there?

1353
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,910
Wow! Outdoor tree bondage!

1354
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,260
Kinky!

1355
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,130
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

1356
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,780
I've been fucking hanging in this ...

1357
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,980
fucking tree for three fucking hours!

1358
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:25,800
And it's fucking beginning to get ...

1359
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,190
on my fucking nerves!

1360
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,720
I can see you balls!

1361
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,270
Fuck!

1362
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,730
Will you fucking morons get me the
fuck out of this fucking tree ...

1363
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:43,750
so I can cone down and kick
your fucking asses?

1364
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,830
I'd sure like to!

1365
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,990
But how are we supposed
to do that, huh?

1366
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,610
I don't care, just get me down!

1367
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,970
Alright .. alright.
We've got to make a plan.

1368
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:59,410
How do we get him down?

1369
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:02,050
Preferably without getting
our asses kicked ...

1370
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:03,400
got that, Poke?

1371
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:07,060
Can't we just leave him up there?

1372
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,040
My day has been bad enough already.

1373
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:12,380
No,

1374
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,160
Okay ...

1375
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,960
How about ... throwing coconuts at him
until he falls down?

1376
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:20,620
No way!

1377
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:25,000
Okay, then ... We could rig this
tree with dynamite and ...

1378
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,160
Boom!

1379
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:27,710
Instant untangling!

1380
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:29,030
- No!
- No!

1381
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,090
Oh well ...

1382
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:32,700
If you don't like my suggestions ...

1383
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,190
I can just as well shut up.

1384
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:36,270
Who is going to listen to me anyway?

1385
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,160
Lori, don't start it again!

1386
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:51,210
I'm completely finished with my nerves,

1387
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,960
and this is the last thing I need now.

1388
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,880
- We really should-
- Shh!

1389
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:58,030
Did you hear something?

1390
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,180
I think, someone's coming!

1391
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,110
Aah, that was a good one!

1392
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:12,320
Okay, it was just Poke.

1393
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,790
Where were we?

1394
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,530
Well, this completely threw me off.

1395
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,410
I think, I was about to say-

1396
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,270
Freeze!

1397
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,250
This is the THX!

1398
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:32,510
Ah, look who we have here!

1399
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:35,170
You are under arrest!

1400
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,610
Don't even think of moving ...

1401
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:39,400
or else ...

1402
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:45,020
This is really annoying,
Mr. Lionel Scruffycat.

1403
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:49,700
No matter what we try, you just
refuse to die.

1404
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,530
I have no idea how you made it.

1405
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,030
Your parachute was never
supposed to open.

1406
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:59,820
Well, indeed. It didn't.

1407
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:02,840
You seem to be a really tough guy.

1408
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:06,150
But that will be no longer
of help to you.

1409
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,660
Because now you're coming with us!

1410
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:12,000
Oh you! You tried to kill Lionel?

1411
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,580
You bastards!

1412
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:16,570
Come here!
I'll slit your chests open ...

1413
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:17,830
and drink your blood ...

1414
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:19,380
while your hearts are still beating!

1415
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:22,110
I'll kill you! I will kill you!

1416
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:32,110
Ah, felines are so easy to overcome.

1417
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,460
Just grab them by the
scruff of their neck ...

1418
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:39,130
and their carrying reflexes
will kick in.

1419
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,890
Now, isn't she cute?

1420
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,590
Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!

1421
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:48,310
How on earth did you
manage to follow us ...

1422
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:51,220
without a copy of the diary?

1423
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:53,510
Well, that's easy.

1424
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:57,710
It's true, you did have the only
copy of that book, but ...

1425
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:00,520
here is a little hint for your
next adventure.

1426
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:03,070
If you browse through
secret documents ...

1427
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,890
You should rather not do that ...

1428
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:07,120
directly underneath a surveillance cam.

1429
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:08,870
D'oh!

1430
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,510
Okay, enough talking!

1431
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:15,690
Ladies and Gentlemen,
your vacation ends here.

1432
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:18,710
I don't know what the
producer has in mind for you ...

1433
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:20,900
but it sure won't be pretty.

1434
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,420
Now go.

1435
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,620
I said, "Go"!

1436
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:28,950
You can't do that! I'm American!

1437
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:30,390
Shut up!

1438
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,120
Go!

1439
01:21:45,550 --> 01:22:12,970
The journey continues
on disk 2.
