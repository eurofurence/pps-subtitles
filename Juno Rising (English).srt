00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,866
Warning! Decompression Hazard!

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,401
Come here! There's a...
there's a fucking...

5
00:00:57,576 --> 00:01:01,541
Alert the fucking crew... there's a
fucking passenger emergency in...

6
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,000
whatever the fucking place is!

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,946
Complying. Correction, unable
to comply. No crew on duty.

8
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:15,008
No on duty crew? Is anybody out there? Hey!

9
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:23,498
Wait. No. What the? They're dying!

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh shit. Hey you in
there! Wake up! Wake up!

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,474
Unable to comply. Only on duty
crew may initiate reanimation.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,790
You said there's no on duty crew on board!
So guess what? I'm your fucking captain now!

13
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:42,893
Complying. Emergency
passenger promotion for Lyra Scenic.

14
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:49,062
That probably should have been harder.
Now, computer, open this pod before I...

15
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:50,740
Alert! Alert!

16
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:52,589
Oh what is it now?

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There is a fucking passenger
emergency in container 801.

18
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,000
Just open the pod!

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Complying. Correction, unable
to comply. Service code 4879.

20
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,767
Hold on. I'm getting you out of there.

21
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,152
Captain, pod 3 is now open.

22
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh shit.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,572
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

24
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:34,559
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What the hell?

25
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,856
You're... you're alive!

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,820
Computer, alert the fucking crew!
There's a fucking passenger emergency!

27
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:48,911
I tried that. We are on our own.

28
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,746
I had to crack open your pod
before it freeze-dried you.

29
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:57,824
No wonder I feel like there's
a solar flare in my skull.

30
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:02,520
There's a reason why
defrosting usually takes 8 hours.

31
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:06,364
You are not part of the crew, are you?

32
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:12,000
Hell no. Name's Lyra. And
I'm just a prisoner, like you.

33
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,713
Sorin?

34
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:18,000
Sorin Jax. How do you know my name?

35
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:21,073
Well, it's on the screen.

36
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh yeah, sure.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We have to find out what happened.

38
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm pretty sure we weren't
supposed to wake up like this.

39
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:37,485
Something must have gone terribly wrong.

40
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:42,507
These pods are meant to have systems in
place that keep us alive in an emergency.

41
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:47,205
It should have properly reanimated us and
opened the moment it switched to backup power.

42
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,054
Sounds like you know
your way around spaceships.

43
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, we're in an EZ-Trans container. Been
hauling them around for a long time myself.

44
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:59,897
It turns people into cargo.
It's all self-contained.

45
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:02,435
It's basically the cheapest
way to get around the system.

46
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,000
You worked a freighter?

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,647
Yeah, sort of. I used
to fly one, to be precise.

48
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:15,518
Any idea who's in this one?

49
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,249
Only authorized crew may-

50
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,937
Just open the damn pod, computer!

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,305
Unable to comply. Service code 4879.

52
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:31,729
Huh?

53
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,364
Your pod said the same.

54
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:37,000
Code 4879, that's a new one.

55
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:43,748
Life support is all messed up. His body's
gonna poison itself if we don't get him out.

56
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:46,000
Here, help me pull the lid.

57
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:51,000
No, no, no. Wait, wait,
wait. Let me get up here.

58
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:57,000
These pods have an emergency
release hatch right here.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He... he's not moving.

60
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,482
Do you know first aid?

61
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:10,000
Help me get him out.

62
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:14,360
Got him?

63
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:16,092
Yeah, yeah. Got him.

64
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, put him over there.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,725
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

66
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,625
Huh.

68
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:31,491
There. No pulse. No breathing.

69
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,000
And he's almost frozen.

70
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,192
Even if I knew how to do muzzle
to beak, he's probably too far gone.

71
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,000
Damn.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So what the hell's going on here?

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,202
I'm pretty sure we haven't
made it to Vesta prison camp yet.

74
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,000
Computer, status report.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,421
Complying. Correction, unable to comply.

76
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:53,270
I wouldn't trust the computer.

77
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:56,000
It promoted me to captain
without putting up a fight.

78
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,199
Stay here and catch your breath.

79
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,900
I'll try the door and check to...

80
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:04,000
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

81
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,397
See the red light over there?

82
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:09,000
Red light means a hard vacuum
on the other side of the airlock.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,719
You're gonna kill yourself.

84
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:13,125
No need to shout at me, Sorin.

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,545
It's my first time off world.

86
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,000
Sorry, captain.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,753
If I really were a captain, I
would probably know what to do.

88
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't worry. There are
procedures for emergencies like this.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,151
Take this suit you went
to sleep in, for example.

90
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:32,583
It doubles as a space suit if
you add a matching helmet.

91
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:36,441
There should be a box somewhere.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, right here.

93
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:48,000
I wouldn't want to go on an actual
space walk in one of these, but...

94
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, you never know.

95
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:51,469
Oh.

96
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, what?

97
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,609
One of the helmets is already missing.

98
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,122
The fourth pod!

99
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:04,356
It was already open when I woke up.

100
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:10,316
Whoever woke up first must have
taken the helmet to get help or...

101
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,317
Or leave us to die.

102
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,123
Which I don't intend to do today. So...

103
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,891
So, how much time do we have left?

104
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't think I'm ready to go yet.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I feel like shit.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, you and me both.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,625
Cold, dehydrated, full of nasty
drugs and low on blood sugar.

108
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,000
It's a miracle you woke up at all.

109
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, I have artificial heart
and liver replacements.

110
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,790
Maybe it triggered some kind of fail-safe.

111
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,069
Maybe.

112
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:42,172
Heart and liver, huh?

113
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,672
You got some wealthy parents, don't you?

114
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,000
Everyone on Earth has wealthy parents.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,124
Yeah.

116
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:52,000
Bloody UN and their bloody birth control.

117
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:55,140
I could have worked my
tail off for ERG until I died

118
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:58,266
and I would have never been able
to afford the papers to have a kid.

119
00:07:58,742 --> 00:07:59,871
Could have?

120
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,079
Yeah, damn right.

121
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:04,157
I stole a freighter, kicked
them goddamn Earthers out

122
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,000
and took my wife to a better place.

123
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,000
Sina's people took better care
of us than Earth UN ever did.

124
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:12,000
Sina Stillwater?

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,112
So you're one of her outlaws.

126
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:16,000
We are not outlaws.

127
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,000
We're pioneers.

128
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:21,476
We're building ourselves
a new home away from Earth!

129
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:25,436
I don't think anyone would
call Juno Station a home.

130
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,000
At least we can be who we want
to be and have the families we want.

131
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,312
I have three healthy kids now.

132
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:35,000
On Earth, that would have
got me shipped to Vesta.

133
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,439
But we are being
shipped to Vesta right now.

134
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:39,240
Yeah, right.

135
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:40,778
Okay, so I got caught.

136
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,000
Shit happens, all right?

137
00:08:43,678 --> 00:08:46,000
Still not regretting a damn thing.

138
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:48,000
How about you?

139
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,466
Well, I used to work for CommNet News

140
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:55,137
until someone decided I was sticking my
nose into matters I should have left alone.

141
00:08:55,407 --> 00:08:57,000
Government stuff?

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You bet.

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Large-scale corruption.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
UN officials in bed with the
Extraplanetary Resources Group.

145
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:08,000
I broke into the CEO's
CommNet account to get the proof.

146
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:12,187
Unfortunately, a co-worker
turned out to be on their payroll.

147
00:09:12,212 --> 00:09:12,883
Yeah.

148
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:16,741
He turned me in and that's how I got here.

149
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,490
Nice.

150
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:21,000
So who's the outlaw now?

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Huh.

152
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:26,515
What does that mean?

153
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,000
It means someone's coming. Get behind me!

154
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,080
What?

155
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:36,347
You're alive?

156
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, no thanks to you.

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,113
I'm sorry, I thought you were already...

158
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:41,075
Dead.

159
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So you're...

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,911
Trent Binkin?

162
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,705
Yeah, that's me.

163
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,000
So Trent, what's cooking outside?

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,181
Made any new friends?

165
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:53,248
The crew.

166
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,000
They're all dead.

167
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:57,442
Every single one of them.

168
00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:59,000
We're the only ones left alive.

208

Happy now?

209
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,000
Hell yeah!

210
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,000
So let's see

211
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:13,000
Let me go and get over there

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,307
Let's see what we got here

213
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:17,483
Sorry buddy

214
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,583
This ship is a SpaceX Rhino Mark 4

215
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:32,645
Owner is the Extraplanetary Resources Group

216
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, who else?

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,214
Could you fly it?

218
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,342
Totally

219
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:39,214
I mean, I don't have a
type rating for this model

220
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,000
But who gives?

221
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:46,353
This is weird

222
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:47,402
What is weird?

223
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:50,211
The ship is on standby

224
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:52,315
Everything is properly shut down

225
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:55,323
Main reactor's off, critical
system are in backup power

226
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:58,129
There is no sign of an emergency

227
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,182
Can we turn it back on?

228
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:02,174
Hmm, let me see

229
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,109
Nope, controls are locked

230
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,669
Computer, this is the captain speaking

231
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,070
Unlock the controls

232
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:10,412
Complying

233
00:15:10,437 --> 00:15:12,480
Correction, unable to comply

234
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,241
System unlock requires a
flight crew level override keycard

235
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,123
Well, was worth a try I guess

236
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,499
Well, the flight crew is still here

237
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll see what they have

238
00:15:23,142 --> 00:15:24,166
Alright

239
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,592
How the hell did we lose pressure?

240
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:33,365
Each deck is divided into cells that
automatically seal if there's a leak

241
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:36,431
And even if someone
circumvented all safety measures

242
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,570
There's always the airlocks

243
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:39,558
Two in the front and two in the back

244
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:43,505
Surviving decompression
is part of ERG's basic training

245
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:46,462
So you're saying this
massacre was intentional?

246
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,812
I am not saying anything right now

247
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,272
Can we check the airlocks from here?

248
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:56,893
Yeah, let's do that

249
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:04,926
That's... what the?

250
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:06,000
What is it?

251
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,000
The outer hatch is open

252
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,068
Huh, the second one too

253
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,396
Could this be how the ship was vented?

254
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,000
Unlikely, there's no way you
can remotely open both sides

255
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Wow!

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,349
Whoa, lookie there!

257
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:26,000
Survivors!

258
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:28,254
Airlock 4, let's go

259
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,943
Uh, not so fast

260
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:32,110
Why not?

261
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,160
Because I say so

262
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,000
Ahhhhh!

263
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,760
Computer!

264
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:38,681
Blacklist Trent Binkin from all access!

265
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,000
Affirmative

266
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:45,642
Shoot me, and you will die a
very lonely death on this ship

267
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,289
Put the taser down, and we can talk

268
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:51,455
Holy shit, you've got your wits together, girl

269
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,629
You did all this, am I right?

270
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:55,948
Shut up or else

271
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,733
Or else what?

272
00:16:57,758 --> 00:17:01,466
Without me, you're not
going to get this ship anywhere

273
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:07,000
And neither are you, because,
well, I've got the keycard

274
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,000
I thought so. And what now?

275
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:15,000
Maybe the card alone
doesn't let me fly this ship

276
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:21,000
But in all other aspects, it's still pretty
much the backstage pass for this gig

277
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:23,334
Airlock security is still off

278
00:17:23,922 --> 00:17:28,273
And all I have to do is flick
this in front of a terminal

279
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:31,000
And the survivors are gone

280
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,550
Do you want that?

281
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,484
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

282
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:37,149
Let's take it down a notch, shall we?

283
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:41,045
No, you've got exactly five
seconds to make me the captain

284
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:43,434
Five, four

285
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,245
Hold it!

286
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,522
We are a bunch of convicted criminals
on our way to the prison cap on Vesta

287
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:50,529
We don't care about your business

288
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:53,000
We just want to get out of here alive

289
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,891
Three, two

290
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:56,794
You can't be...

291
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,867
Alright, alright, for fuck's sake!

292
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,377
Computer, transfer captain's
privileges to Trant Binkin

293
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:03,208
Complying

294
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,261
Trant Binkin is now the captain

295
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,114
Thank you, my dear

296
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,640
Computer, vent Airlock 4

297
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:09,596
Affirmative

298
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,940
No!

299
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,156
You son of a bitch, you murdered them

300
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:15,000
You fucking murdered...

301
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:22,000
Pro tip, don't jump
the guy with the gun

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,173
MY HELMET! I ... CANT ... BREATHE ...

303
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:34,352
Come over here

304
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:40,119
I am the only one who can save you now

305
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:43,285
Now drop the goddamn stun gun

306
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:44,490
Drop it!

307
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:45,515
Drop it!

308
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,118
Come here

309
00:18:50,143 --> 00:18:51,138
Pro tip

310
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:55,000
Don't expect the taser to work
very well through a space suit

311
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:03,190
Lyra, are you alright?

312
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,468
Shit, that really, really hurt

313
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:09,000
But I think I'm okay

314
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:27,000
Today's your lucky day, Trent.

315
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:30,000
Enough people have
died on this ship already

316
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,369
Captain Trent Binkin incapacitated

317
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:38,000
Transferring captain's rights to Lyra
Senick according to emergency protocols

318
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:44,000
So, here's the goddamn keycard

319
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:47,199
Computer, complete authorization

320
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:50,000
Please scan the flight crew override key

321
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,038
Authorization confirmed

322
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,018
Bridge controls unlocked

323
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:58,095
Finally!

324
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,925
Let me go ahead...

325
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, hey!

326
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:04,895
First we're gonna gotta power this baby up

327
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,000
Reactor ready in 3, 2, 1

328
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:16,799
And now let's see if we have enough air
to get at least this section repressurized

329
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,000
Let me see...

330
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:25,865
Ah

331
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,421
Ah

332
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:35,913
And now let's get this thing to Juno
Station before Earth notices we're missing

333
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:37,222
Time to strap in

334
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,007
Oh, wait a minute

335
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm the captain of this ship

336
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:42,864
You're what?

337
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:47,017
-Can I help you?
-Ahh, let me get this thing off first

338
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:50,534
Come on here, I'll show
you how it's done. There we are!

339
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,446
Sheesh

340
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:55,372
Computer, who's the captain?

341
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:57,642
Captain on duty is Lyra Senick.

342
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,079
Oh, I see!

343
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,650
Well then...

344
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:11,000
Tell me what to do, Miss Captain

345
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Huh!

346
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:20,000
Mr. Sorin Jax?

347
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Energize!

348
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:35,094
This

349
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,489
This is not how any of this works, okay?

350
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,137
Lighten up, it was a joke

351
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,000
Computer, grant full pilot's and
navigation rights to Mr. Sorin Jax!

352
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,277
Affirmative

353
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:50,371
Thank you

354
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,758
Now, fasten your seatbelts, everyone!

355
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:54,579
This is going to be a high G burn

356
00:21:54,604 --> 00:22:01,304
Standby for acceleration in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

357
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes!

358
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:24,691
Bureau of Investigation,
Detective Tony White

359
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,923
What can I do for you?

360
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:28,623
I am trying to reach Deputy Chief Erickson

361
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,642
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but Mr. Erickson
is currently not available

362
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:34,877
But if you let me know the nature of
your inquiry, I'll be more than happy to...

363
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:36,635
Then patch me through to Chief.

364
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,830
Oh, I'm afraid Chief Lewis
is not taking calls at this time.

365
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,638
Look, I have a very
sensitive matter to report.

366
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:44,713
I need to talk to someone in charge!

367
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:48,045
Oh, I am 100% in
charge for criminal reports

368
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,714
And I promise your matter
will be in safe hands with me, sir!

369
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:53,771
Are you new here? Do you even know who I am?

370
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:55,917
It's my first day here, yes

371
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,819
And you are Theodore Copeland

372
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:01,160
Director of Fleet Operations of
the Extraplanetary Resources Group

373
00:23:01,295 --> 00:23:02,341
Damn right!

374
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:06,332
And you're now going to tell me
how to reach either Lewis or Erickson

375
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:08,838
Or is this also going to be your last day?

376
00:23:08,894 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh, I wish I could, but I can't

377
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You see, they have both
been suspended from duty

378
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:16,340
What? This is the
first time I've heard of it

379
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:17,848
Why wasn't I informed?

380
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:21,133
Excuse me, sir, but are you
a member of this agency?

381
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:24,453
I've known Lewis and Erickson
for longer than you can read or write

382
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,184
They're still of the old guard

383
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,735
They know how to get things done

384
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,118
And who to call when
something important happens!

385
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,530
Not like you, fresh out of college

386
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:36,385
But too afraid to wipe your own
ass without filing a request first

387
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,627
Well, there's no official statement
about the reason of their suspension

388
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,314
But if I had to guess

389
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:45,000
It was probably because it wasn't
just their own asses they've been wiping

390
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,913
And by the way, this call is being recorded

391
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:50,035
So if you enjoy talking
yourself into trouble

392
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,000
By all means, just keep going!

393
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:56,165
All right.

394
00:23:56,832 --> 00:23:59,000
One of our ships is missing.

395
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,419
Reg number 85473362

396
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:05,000
Finally, we're getting somewhere!

397
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,159
Hang on...

398
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:12,782
A Mark IV Rhino named Darwin

399
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:16,069
Departed July 25th from Bogota, Colombia

400
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:19,590
Destination Vesta Station

401
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:23,602
Left controlled space to sector 4385

402
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:25,097
No voluntary tracking

403
00:24:25,122 --> 00:24:26,537
Let me send you the flight data

404
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:29,000
It'll show you exactly when we lost contact.

405
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,348
Okay, I see

406
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,835
And what makes you think the loss
is the result of a criminal offense?

407
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,564
Because it happened in
the middle of pioneer territory!

408
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:39,824
Have you ruled out any technical failure?

409
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,631
We're talking about the
kidnapping of 25 crew members

410
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:45,328
Millions worth of cargo for Vesta and Ceres

411
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:47,277
And three federal prisoners.

412
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:48,648
Four.

413
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:49,571
What?

414
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:52,772
The manifest lists four prisoners in cryo

415
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:53,643
Whatever!

416
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:56,294
If they had prisoners on board,
why didn't you have an escort?

417
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,000
Because the idiots in your
department didn't provide one!

418
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:03,122
There was a military vessel

419
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:05,133
Scheduled to join your
freighter the next day

420
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:07,373
Yes, a whole day!

421
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:09,100
Do you even know what that costs?

422
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:12,707
Sir, that transport was a
violation of federal regulations

423
00:25:12,732 --> 00:25:16,685
And the prisoner transport also means I have
to get the Department of Justice involved.

424
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,773
Listen, you little bean-counter

425
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:20,444
Are you going to help me or not?

426
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:22,147
Oh, I am trying, but...

427
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:24,000
You know what? Forget I called you.

428
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,141
I'm withdrawing my report.

429
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm going to call the military instead.

430
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,539
Time to learn how to wipe
your own ass, Mr. Copeland.

431
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:33,000
What a moron.

432
00:25:34,738 --> 00:25:36,832
Bureau of Investigation,
Detective Tony White.

433
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:38,470
What can I do for you?

434
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:51,000
Welcome to Juno Station.

435
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:54,519
Please identify yourself and
state the intention of your visit.

436
00:25:54,993 --> 00:25:58,573
Didn't you get the documents
I emailed you an hour ago?

437
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,824
Well, yes.

438
00:26:03,952 --> 00:26:05,425
Yes, we did.

439
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,548
But you arrived here on a stolen
freighter with a full cargo hold

440
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:14,275
And no proof of identification whatsoever

441
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:16,791
The only reason we let you even dock here

442
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:20,453
was that our scans only showed
three men and lots of cargo on board.

443
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:24,136
Look, I explained everything in my email.

444
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:27,000
My name is Sorin Jax, I'm a pioneer.

445
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,235
I have family in Habitat
Level 31, Third Quadrant.

446
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:32,706
Look it up if you don't believe me!

447
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,862
There's only one Sorin Jax on our records

448
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:37,764
And he's been missing for more than a year.

449
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,714
Yeah, and now I'm back!

450
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:42,347
I don't care about your life story!

451
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,055
Everyone who comes
through these doors has one.

452
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,895
And you know why this station still exists?

453
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:51,050
Because I don't believe everything I hear.

454
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,275
If you don't have a proper
ID, you have two options

455
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:57,201
You can sign Form A, that's for trade.

456
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:02,000
Or Form B, that's if you
want to seek political asylum

457
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,817
And until either of these is approved

458
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:07,871
You are going to stay on your ship.

459
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:10,297
The lease for your dock expires in 24 hours

460
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:13,000
Power is free, enjoy your stay.

461
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:15,863
Will you cut the crap and let me in?

462
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:18,785
I used to live here, goddammit!

463
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:23,753
Damn, this place is falling apart.

464
00:27:26,722 --> 00:27:28,722
Alright, I want to trade.

465
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:32,341
No problem!

466
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:36,682
All I need from you is Form A, your
contract, and a detailed packing list

467
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
What if I don't have a contract?

468
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
There's a section for
trade offers on our network.

469
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:49,642
How about you?

470
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:54,093
Personally? I happen to have a
full container of wallpaper paste.

471
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:58,802
Oops, and the price just went up!

472
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,319
Better act quickly!

473
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:03,100
Are you trying to bribe me?

474
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:08,121
Maybe we should try
political asylum instead

475
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,175
We are refugees after all.

476
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,447
What? You really want
to stay on this rust bucket?

477
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:16,737
What? This is my home!

478
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,359
Excuse me sir, how long does
an application usually take?

479
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:25,335
Not very long, a
month maybe, or two

480
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,403
Are you kidding me?

481
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,313
Back when I moved in, it
didn't take longer than a day!

482
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:33,898
The safety of our community
is our highest priority.

483
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,316
How cool is that?

484
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,066
Sorin, look

485
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,069
What?

486
00:28:44,196 --> 00:28:48,136
Did you know we had twelve and a
half tons of coffee beans on board?

487
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh

488
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,207
There, right next to the three
containers full of chocolate pudding.

489
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,560
Hold it right there,
what did you just say?

490
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:02,520
Coffee beans and chocolate pudding!

491
00:29:02,552 --> 00:29:05,000
Hang on, I've got to make a call.

492
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:18,111
That was brilliant!

493
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,082
I think you found their weak spot.

494
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:22,000
Of course!

495
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:27,405
Please wait, someone is
on their way to meet with you.

496
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,000
Prepare to have your load inspected.

497
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,015
That's what she said!

498
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't ruin it

499
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What?

500
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:55,261
Sorin! You? Here?

501
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,630
I thought they had caught
you and sent you to Vesta!

502
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,293
Yeah, can't believe it myself!

503
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:03,431
Oh god, it's so good to see you!

504
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:04,987
Yeah, you too!

505
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:09,303
Wait, you know each other?

506
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:14,078
You and Sina Stillwater,
Chief Commander of the Pioneers?

507
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:15,628
Yeah, why?

508
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:18,824
This could have been so much easier!

509
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:26,445
Calm down, they wouldn't have
patched me through to her anyways.

510
00:30:26,713 --> 00:30:28,925
That's a nice new ship you have there!

511
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:31,400
Actually, it's my ship.

512
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:35,179
Oh yeah, right, and I
am just the lowly pilot.

513
00:30:35,722 --> 00:30:37,722
And who the hell is she?

514
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,581
I am Lyra Senick, refugee
and freelance journalist

515
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,099
Well, pleased to make your
acquaintance, Mrs. Freelance Refugee!

516
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:52,875
If you want any of the coffee,
you'd better take me seriously!

517
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:57,498
I like the way you think.

518
00:30:57,793 --> 00:31:01,861
Don't worry, here on Juno
we take everyone seriously.

519
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:06,000
Especially those who have
lost their faith in Earth like you.

520
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:08,676
Welcome to your new life, Lyra!

521
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:10,931
What if I don't want a new life?

522
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:15,753
Once you've experienced what true freedom
is like, you will never want to go back

523
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,565
I promise you that!

524
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:24,312
Officer, could you please get the
paperwork done for these two people?

525
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:26,755
Consider them cleared for immigration.

526
00:31:26,897 --> 00:31:27,897
But... But...

527
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:32,975
Oh, and if you could get it done in the next
five minutes, that would be really great.

528
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You have my permission to
keep your mouth shut, thank you.

529
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:49,825
Now come on, I bet you have one hell of a
story to tell, and I want to hear all of it!

530
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,570
Uh, Sina, there's one more little thing...

531
00:31:52,673 --> 00:31:54,000
Yes?

532
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:57,000
We are actually three.

533
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Oh, I see.

534
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,424
Officer, we need another copy, please.

535
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:04,000
No, no, no, I don't think you want that.

536
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,488
He is our prisoner, he tried to kill us.

537
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,368
Seriously?

538
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:13,345
And why didn't you just
kick him out the airlock?

539
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,194
Well...

540
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:16,527
Everyone on this ship died because of him!

541
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:19,257
Yeah, and what am I
supposed to do with him?

542
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:20,746
Put him in jail?

543
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,697
And who's gonna pay for this?

544
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:23,722
You?

545
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:29,231
He managed to break out of cryo and
single-handedly kill every person on board

546
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:33,000
and would have hijacked this freighter
for himself if it hadn't been for us.

547
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,428
It's all way too sophisticated
for a simple robbery.

548
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,000
Maybe you can get some info out of him!

549
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:43,856
That sounds like someone
we might have a use for.

550
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,389
We can't trust him!

551
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:48,000
Ah, leave it to me, I'm a professional.

552
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah, she's right, she knows
what she's doing. I'll be right back.

553
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,809
I have a bad feeling about this.

554
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:07,488
So there he is.

555
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:09,000
He says his name is Trent.

556
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:12,000
Trent Binkin, probably in alias.

557
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,000
Well, get rid of the
tape, I want to talk to him.

558
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Alright

559
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,268
Be careful though, he will tell
you everything you want to hear!

560
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:23,920
The ship's a bomb, we're all going to die!

561
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:26,945
Oh well, that's definitely
not what I wanted to hear

562
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,088
Red alert, red alert!

563
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:32,202
Evacuate sections A to C immediately!

564
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:35,769
This is not a drill, I
repeat, this is not a drill!

565
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:36,666
Red alert!

566
00:33:36,691 --> 00:33:40,000
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

567
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:43,000
Places everyone, starting over.

568
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,796
Listen, listen, it's not too late yet.

569
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,000
The time is running, but if
you let me free, I can stop it!

570
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,605
So, you say there's a bomb on this ship?

571
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,762
The biggest one you've ever seen!

572
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:55,964
But be more specific!

573
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,063
Matter, antimatter

574
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:00,000
doesn't matter!

575
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:06,000
It's like a SD-Z/4, similar
containment, but twice the capacity

576
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,304
But that's insane, who
builds something like that?

577
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,936
Someone who wants the entire
system to see their fireworks.

578
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,064
Earth, of course.

579
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah, but who on Earth?

580
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,501
If I told you, I'd be a dead rat!

581
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:20,826
Why do they want to destroy us?

582
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,433
I have no idea!

583
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:24,457
What about the crew of the freighter?

584
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:31,101
Faking an emergency and sending a mayday
was the easiest way to get the bomb to Juno.

585
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:34,289
And as you can see, it worked like a charm!

586
00:34:34,314 --> 00:34:36,986
You really should work on your security!

587
00:34:38,674 --> 00:34:41,841
You better tell me where that bomb is, or

588
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:43,068
Or what?

589
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,274
OR...

590
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:45,785
Listen to me

591
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,617
Here's what I have to offer.

592
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:53,274
If you tamper with the containment or try to
remove it from the station, it will explode.

593
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,430
The timer was activated the
moment the ship entered the dock

594
00:34:57,621 --> 00:35:02,222
This was supposed to give me time
to leave before everyone blows up!

595
00:35:02,706 --> 00:35:06,834
The mechanism can only be deactivated
by the same person who activated it

596
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:08,466
Me!

597
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:11,441
And why are you
telling us all this?

598
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:15,826
Because I might be a
greedy and heartless bastard

599
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,269
but I'd rather
not turn into plasma!

600
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:20,000
Easy, isn't it?

601
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:24,000
You are a miserable piece of shit.

602
00:35:24,146 --> 00:35:27,730
But at least you are a piece
of shit that makes sense.

603
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:30,247
I can work with that.

604
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:34,861
Fine, let me walk free and we
will all live to see another day.

605
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:36,929
Under one condition!

606
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:39,000
The bomb stays with me.

607
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,000
Deal?

608
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Deal!

609
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:55,335
So, this is the bomb container?

610
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,272
Yes.

611
00:35:56,297 --> 00:35:57,423
Okay.

612
00:35:57,709 --> 00:35:59,510
Wait, are you crazy?

613
00:35:59,535 --> 00:36:02,000
One wrong move, and
we're gonna blow to bits!

614
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,268
Let me do this!

615
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:05,000
How do we know it's not a trap?

616
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,758
Listen, Brainiac, in case you haven't
noticed, we're all sitting in the same boat.

617
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:13,178
I don't want to die, just
as you don't want to die.

618
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:16,000
He's right, let the man do his job.

619
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I hope he knows what he's doing.

620
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,560
Here we go...

621
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:31,854
Step one, disarm the watchdog.

622
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:36,000
What was that?

623
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:40,000
You mean, apart from the
moment you shat your pants?

624
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,673
I'll show you who...

625
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:43,670
Will you shut up?

626
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:49,420
Alright, step two, reset
the trigger program...

627
00:36:50,606 --> 00:36:55,550
General Stillwater, with all due respect,
but you just can't stand here and do nothing!

628
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:58,000
I said shut up!

629
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,590
Thank you.

630
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:05,000
Now, step three, deactivate the bomb...

631
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:14,825
Alright, that's it. She's all yours!

632
00:37:15,223 --> 00:37:16,557
Thank you!

633
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:18,826
You're welcome.

634
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:23,323
Oh, and I hereby apply for
political asylum at Juno Station.

635
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:28,577
Before I grant you asylum, I
have to know who sent you.

636
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:30,756
Hey, that wasn't part of our deal!

637
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:32,809
The deal just changed.

638
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:36,495
Look, if I told you, you
might as well just shoot me!

639
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:39,081
Alright, if that's what you want.

640
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:41,000
What?

641
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:45,000
Fucking idiot.

642
00:37:55,138 --> 00:38:00,012
And that's how I learned to
stop worrying and love the bomb!

643
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,767
Oh, what an idiot indeed!

644
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,224
What the hell did he...
What the hell did he expect?

645
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:11,777
To the bomb!

646
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,370
To the bomb!

647
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:14,153
Whatever...

648
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:16,000
Yes!

649
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:27,309
Hell yeah

650
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,620
What's up with you, Lyra?

651
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:33,000
Not in the mood for a party?

652
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, I don't know...

653
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:40,361
I know he was a bad guy,
but it still feels wrong to me.

654
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:42,090
Oh, seriously?

655
00:38:42,115 --> 00:38:45,155
That guy tried to murder us!

656
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:49,000
And he even tried to kill you twice!

657
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So you're incredibly
lucky that you're still alive!

658
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,000
Sorry for having a conscience.

659
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,806
For that guy, our deal was off the
moment that bomb stopped ticking.

660
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:01,831
Simple game theory.

661
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,633
Yeah, and she'd also give you
a witty quote from The Art of War

662
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:11,420
When she's too drunk to remember!

663
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh, shut up and drink!

664
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:21,189
Ah, yeah.

665
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:23,280
Your tactical training.

666
00:39:23,305 --> 00:39:24,126
I get it.

667
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:26,000
It's all professional.

668
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,334
Killing people while
delivering funny one-liners.

669
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,298
Which school did you go to again?

670
00:39:31,323 --> 00:39:33,558
Schwarzenegger University?

671
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:36,279
Jeez, lighten up!

672
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:37,943
We're not on Earth anymore!

673
00:39:37,968 --> 00:39:40,382
This is how you survive out here!

674
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, and it's also why I'd
rather go back home than stay here.

675
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,373
But that's not an option right
now, so you'd better get used to it!

676
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,455
Yeah, and what the hell

677
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,762
Don't you ever get drunk?

678
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:56,000
I mean, you had twice as much
boozamahol as Sorin

679
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,217
And he's got some training!

680
00:39:58,242 --> 00:39:59,168
Yep!

681
00:39:59,684 --> 00:40:00,828
I'm afraid not.

682
00:40:00,853 --> 00:40:02,107
Artificial liver.

683
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:05,109
Breaks it right down the
moment it hits my bloodstream

684
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,000
And that means no buzz for me!

685
00:40:08,936 --> 00:40:12,936
I am... I am so, so sorry!

686
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:22,028
I'm sure she knows some weird-ass engineer
in the belt who can make that adjustable...

687
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:25,292
Alright, I think it's
time to call it a night.

688
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:28,280
Ah, come on, come on,
come on, please stay, come on.

689
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:31,955
I'll turn the belter humor
down a notch for you, okay?

690
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,509
Yeah!

691
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:36,679
Today is the first day
of your new life after all!

692
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:40,815
Yes it is, and you know
what? It's damn scary.

693
00:40:40,878 --> 00:40:43,687
I've never been farther away
from Earth than the moon.

694
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,344
And I'm homesick! like crazy!

695
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:49,782
Well, everyone here had the
price to pay to stay alive, you know.

696
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,772
I've never been much fun at parties

697
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:57,178
Sorry I can't just wash away
my worries with booze like you.

698
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:02,000
Your iron heart saved my life.

699
00:41:03,107 --> 00:41:05,728
Maybe one day your iron liver will too.

700
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:11,100
And who knows what other
hidden superpowers you have?

701
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,945
Apart from being the
designated driver? Not many.

702
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,768
Well, at least you can sell
my parts for scraps when I die.

703
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:24,000
See? That's the spirit!

704
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:29,810
You two act like you're
high school buddies.

705
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:34,617
Almost. We've known
each other for a long time.

706
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:35,584
Yeah.

707
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:38,267
Sorin was one of the very first pioneers.

708
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:39,208
Yep!

709
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:45,106
Back then we were still the tightly
knit band of brothers and sisters!

710
00:41:45,131 --> 00:41:50,000
Huh! Today I can barely keep track
of who's working at my own office.

711
00:41:51,828 --> 00:41:54,300
Sina Stillwater.

712
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:59,864
Adopted daughter of Meredith
Stillwater, CEO of Stillwater Dynamics

713
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:02,962
and John Stillwater, UN military officer.

714
00:42:03,382 --> 00:42:06,047
Military college
graduate, best in her class.

715
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:08,039
Spotless military career.

716
00:42:08,064 --> 00:42:12,132
Leading off-world police operations
with the rank of a master sergeant.

717
00:42:12,735 --> 00:42:15,535
Yep, that's my Wikipedia article.

718
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,000
What's your point?

719
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:21,211
One day you defected to the dark
side, gave up everything you lived for

720
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:24,000
and decided to fight the
system you once swore by.

721
00:42:24,066 --> 00:42:25,106
But why?

722
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:30,339
What turned Sina Stillwater the patriot
into Sina Stillwater the revolutionary?

723
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:35,000
The power of love!

724
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,704
Shut up Sina, you're drunk!

725
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:39,389
No, I'm serious!

726
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,706
The man of my dreams

727
00:42:41,731 --> 00:42:44,098
And he opened my eyes to the truth!

728
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:47,000
Ah Sina, quit the bullshit!

729
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:51,000
Alright, story time!

730
00:42:51,242 --> 00:42:53,000
Privacy please!

731
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:01,853
Listen up, cause I'm
going to tell you something

732
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:05,757
that even good old Sorin
here may not know about me!

733
00:43:05,873 --> 00:43:07,873
Uh oh...

734
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:12,796
They were setting
up that new mining operation

735
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:17,000
Davi something,
in the asteroid belt.

736
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:22,000
It was boring as hell, so I
decided to have a little fun.

737
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,433
I had a crush on one of
the workers in the setup crew

738
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:26,000
What?

739
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,088
And so I asked him out on a date.

740
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:32,128
We ended up spending
a lot of time together

741
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:37,000
And he taught me how different the
world looked from a miner's perspective.

742
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:40,797
I keep getting new
assignments all over the system

743
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:43,562
But we wanted to stay together

744
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:48,087
So I had to choose
between him and the military.

745
00:43:48,246 --> 00:43:51,948
So it was more like the
power of hormones, right?

746
00:43:51,973 --> 00:43:53,000
No!

747
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:55,164
I loved him!

748
00:43:55,656 --> 00:43:58,081
And his simple way of life.

749
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:00,000
Honest work.

750
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:02,106
No politics.

751
00:44:02,177 --> 00:44:05,082
The whole career
madness had worn me out.

752
00:44:05,107 --> 00:44:09,917
All I wanted was my
own home and kids.

753
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:12,000
A family like in the old days!

754
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:16,000
But the powers that be
just couldn't tolerate it.

755
00:44:16,558 --> 00:44:20,000
My family had my future
carefully laid out for me.

756
00:44:20,165 --> 00:44:23,886
And they hated my chains of plans.

757
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,395
I was denied permission
to have my own child

758
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,000
And then one day, Albio disappeared.

759
00:44:30,187 --> 00:44:31,565
Albio?

760
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,597
Albio Sengo.

761
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:35,618
My love.

762
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,621
The day they picked me up
to have my pregnancy terminated

763
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,000
Was the last time I saw him.

764
00:44:42,803 --> 00:44:44,196
His workplace deserted.

765
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:46,486
His name removed from the records.

766
00:44:46,756 --> 00:44:48,097
His CommNet account

767
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:49,573
Dead

768
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,822
They did not even give him a
chance to leave me a message.

769
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:59,423
That's when I knew I could
never be part of that system again.

770
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:04,000
I had been fighting for
the wrong side all my life

771
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:07,000
But if you're officially the other side now

772
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,351
Why didn't Earth just try to attack you?

773
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,952
I don't know.

774
00:45:10,977 --> 00:45:14,620
If I had to guess, it's because
there's no profit in blowing me up.

775
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:16,551
Until now, apparently.

776
00:45:17,705 --> 00:45:20,000
That would almost be a compliment.

777
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:25,839
And it will be my pleasure to
send this little gift back to Earth.

778
00:45:25,912 --> 00:45:28,695
Oh, can we please talk
about this once again?

779
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,975
When we're all sober?

780
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:33,866
And this is really not a good time
to make decisions of that magnitude.

781
00:45:33,993 --> 00:45:37,000
That's the designated
driver talking right there!

782
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,427
I have friends and family on Earth

783
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:41,380
It's my home!

784
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:44,605
Lyra is right, you know.

785
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:49,955
Let's postpone the launch until
we all can think straight again.

786
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:51,896
Thank you!

787
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:54,208
Please excuse her.

788
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:58,033
The power sometimes gets to
her head when she's drunk.

789
00:46:01,746 --> 00:46:04,746
Let's talk about something else!

790
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,248
Is there anything I can
do to make you feel better?

791
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,785
Some sugar might help.

792
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:18,725
That reminds me, we still
have to do some business!

793
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:26,196
Here's a quote for the
containers BZ21 rows 3 to 6

794
00:46:27,399 --> 00:46:29,089
Do we have a deal?

795
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:32,993
Hell yeah we do!

796
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:40,000
Wait a minute, that's my...

797
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:44,593
Relax, you're both getting 50-50, alright?

798
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Deactivate privacy.

799
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:53,000
Sorin, what's in BZ21 rows 3 to 6?

800
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,000
Chocolate pudding for everyone!

801
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:42,000
Access, schmackcess.
Let's try something else.

802
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Maybe...

803
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:50,503
Damn, this is going to take ages
without proper CommNet access!

804
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:55,050
Why now?

805
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:00,695
Uh, hey Lyra!

806
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:01,976
Sorry...

807
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,617
What is it?

808
00:48:05,785 --> 00:48:07,261
We've got a problem.

809
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,948
There is this guy who
wants to buy this...

810
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:12,588
What was it called again?

811
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,925
A reverse-ratcheting routing planer.

812
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:18,730
Uh yeah, what he said.

813
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:20,942
Do you know where it is?

814
00:48:21,294 --> 00:48:23,053
Yeah, let me check.

815
00:48:23,311 --> 00:48:28,282
Ah yes, it's in the container, all the
way in the back, under the air filter.

816
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,480
Ah, gotcha!

817
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:31,241
Oh, and Sorin?

818
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:31,890
Yes?

819
00:48:31,915 --> 00:48:34,141
Would you mind lending
me your CommNet ID?

820
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:37,941
I'm trying to do some research,
and mine got blocked a while ago.

821
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:42,621
You are not going to do
something illegal with it, are you?

822
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:46,938
Not more illegal than
stealing an ERG freighter?

823
00:48:48,366 --> 00:48:50,000
Just don't burn it, okay?

824
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:52,411
We can be glad we're getting
CommNet out here at all.

825
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:55,254
Uuh, here's the key, sending now.

826
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:56,877
Thanks!

827
00:49:01,968 --> 00:49:07,463
Computer, remind me to look up what
a reverse-ratcheting routing planer is.

828
00:49:07,518 --> 00:49:10,935
Affirmative, reminder has
been added to calendar.

829
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:18,782
Now we're talking!

830
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:21,777
And this station is still an active relay!

831
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,441
Those corporate idiots!

832
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:26,514
That's what you get for not
giving a shit about security.

833
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:31,000
And here we go...

834
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,534
What is it this time?

835
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:40,480
Um, captain, we got a
problem again. That thing...

836
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,295
Reverse-ratcheting routing...

837
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,916
Yes, I know!

838
00:49:46,764 --> 00:49:51,098
Well, that thing weighs like a
ton and he didn't bring a pallet jack.

839
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:55,773
Well, tough luck. If he
can't move it, I've got five...

840
00:49:56,431 --> 00:50:00,257
No, six other interested
parties for that item.

841
00:50:00,508 --> 00:50:02,508
Righty-O.

842
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:10,000
Selling at this station is worse than
clearing out your attic on Craigslist.

843
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:13,857
Now for those credentials...

844
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:15,383
Access granted.

845
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:19,000
What? On the first try?

846
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:22,617
No way, don't they
ever swap out their keys?

847
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:26,487
Okay, download. Everything!

848
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:34,295
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
don't trace me back, please...

849
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,871
Oh, sorry, what the fuck?

850
00:50:36,919 --> 00:50:39,000
Sorry, Lyra, I really have...

851
00:50:39,279 --> 00:50:41,200
I paid for it!

852
00:50:41,596 --> 00:50:43,054
Why won't you give it to me?

853
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:44,229
I paid for it!

854
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:46,819
I'm trying to find a solution here, okay?

855
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,507
Listen, do you know how
many years I've been waiting

856
00:50:53,532 --> 00:50:57,285
to get my hands on a
reverse-ratcheting routing planer?

857
00:50:57,686 --> 00:51:01,660
I'm not going to let myself be scammed
by some earthen bitch like you!

858
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:05,000
Get the fuck out of my face! Aaaahh!

859
00:51:05,552 --> 00:51:09,819
Lyra, could you turn off
the Grav-Gen for a minute?

860
00:51:09,844 --> 00:51:12,697
Then we can push the
bloody box out of the pad and...

861
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,021
And then have security
handle this guy, okay?

862
00:51:15,077 --> 00:51:16,739
The what?

863
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:18,855
Artificial gravity, turn it off

864
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,029
Ship console, maintenance settings,
environment, impulse, Grav-Gen.

865
00:51:23,418 --> 00:51:24,050
Okay...

866
00:51:24,075 --> 00:51:26,303
Just uncheck the box on the left.

867
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:28,125
Okay, got it!

868
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,000
Oh, and Sorin?

869
00:51:30,102 --> 00:51:30,856
Yes?

870
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,902
You don't incidentally
have another commit ID?

871
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,000
What?

872
00:51:44,325 --> 00:51:47,325
Great, just great

873
00:51:50,603 --> 00:51:52,514
Warning, safety hazard.

874
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:54,754
Please hold on to the nearest handrail.

875
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,291
GravGen shutting down

876
00:51:56,316 --> 00:51:58,243
In 3, 2, 1

877
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:06,000
I'm not falling...

878
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,928
I'm not falling...

879
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:11,000
Oh shit, I forgot my coffee...

880
00:52:17,976 --> 00:52:21,634
Oh, hey, wait, stay here!

881
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:26,267
I hate it when this happens!

882
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:29,365
Hurry up, Sorin!

883
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:34,002
Oh, please tell me you're done!

884
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,000
Almost there!

885
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,779
Just a few seconds...

886
00:52:38,804 --> 00:52:41,000
And he's outside!

887
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:47,023
Aaaaaa! My tail! Get it off! Get it off!

888
00:52:51,272 --> 00:52:53,043
That's it, I'm coming upstairs.

889
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:55,000
Over and out.

890
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,859
Warning, safety hazard.

891
00:53:01,884 --> 00:53:04,000
Please hold on to the nearest handrail.

892
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,624
Grav-Gen starting up

893
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,000
In 3, 2, 1

894
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:24,163
Computer, cleanup
spillage in captain's room.

895
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:25,628
Complying...

896
00:53:25,653 --> 00:53:27,725
Correction, unable to comply.

897
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,000
No survey staff available.

898
00:53:31,091 --> 00:53:33,700
No cleaner bots? Where's the ship from?

899
00:53:33,725 --> 00:53:35,000
The Middle Ages?

900
00:53:35,768 --> 00:53:38,000
Computer, lights on.

901
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:44,000
Oh no, what a mess!

902
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:49,317
At least the download finished
before they could shut me down.

903
00:53:52,072 --> 00:53:56,377
And bingo, here's
our missing link!

904
00:53:59,591 --> 00:54:00,725
Oh, oh, hey

905
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,695
I'm so sick and tired of this!

906
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,320
Caution!

907
00:54:03,345 --> 00:54:05,345
Thank God it's Fridayyyyyyyy

908
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:14,904
Wet floor.

909
00:54:17,077 --> 00:54:19,036
I hate gravity.

910
00:54:19,305 --> 00:54:21,330
And I hate the absence of gravity.

911
00:54:21,812 --> 00:54:23,834
I nearly threw up my lunch!

912
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:24,920
Ugh

913
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:28,192
Have you ever thrown up out
of the window of a moving car?

914
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:32,471
In Zero-G it's just like that,
only much, much worse!

915
00:54:32,496 --> 00:54:36,100
Oh, too much information.

916
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,813
Anyway, we're now officially sold out.

917
00:54:38,932 --> 00:54:42,128
Except of this one box
of self-sealing stem bolts.

918
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:47,641
Oh, and Sina still needs to come
and pick up the rest of her pudding.

919
00:54:47,728 --> 00:54:49,000
The rest?

920
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,058
Three containers.

921
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:52,577
Did she at least take
the bomb off the ship?

922
00:54:52,602 --> 00:54:53,581
Of course!

923
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,000
Did you check?

924
00:54:56,157 --> 00:54:58,190
Trust me, I'm an expert, okay?

925
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:01,358
Famous last words!

926
00:55:02,056 --> 00:55:04,000
You don't trust people easily, do you?

927
00:55:04,116 --> 00:55:06,356
Childhood trauma, my standard excuse.

928
00:55:06,381 --> 00:55:07,127
Sure.

929
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,556
How about Sina, do you trust her?

930
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:14,209
Not as far as I could
throw her, with gravity on.

931
00:55:15,153 --> 00:55:17,195
She's definitely one of the good guys!

932
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:19,140
But she wants to drop a bomb on Earth

933
00:55:19,165 --> 00:55:22,073
And Earth tried to drop a bomb on us!

934
00:55:22,287 --> 00:55:25,277
It's not like either of us
are ever going to return.

935
00:55:25,302 --> 00:55:29,000
Sorin, my friends and family are on Earth.

936
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:31,290
I don't belong here. I...

937
00:55:31,572 --> 00:55:35,015
I feel so incredibly lonely
and homesick right now

938
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:37,945
I cried myself to sleep last night, and...

939
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:41,000
I'm... I'm sorry.

940
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:45,000
And think of all the innocent
people that are going to die!

941
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
The world will never be the same.

942
00:55:47,321 --> 00:55:49,286
We can't let that happen!

943
00:55:51,465 --> 00:55:53,808
So, what are you going to do?

944
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:54,665
Rat her out?

945
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,087
Of course not!

946
00:55:56,293 --> 00:55:59,139
The Pioneers are my
life insurance right now.

947
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,180
But that doesn't mean I
have to agree with them

948
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:03,000
Nuking my home planet.

949
00:56:03,287 --> 00:56:05,504
You're still thinking like an Earther.

950
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,213
That's why you don't get it.

951
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,902
That there is nothing
left on Earth for us to love

952
00:56:09,927 --> 00:56:13,091
Is the reason why we all
became pioneers in the first place!

953
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:16,823
But what if there is something
left on Earth that she still loves?

954
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,058
Look here.

955
00:56:22,873 --> 00:56:23,975
What's that?

956
00:56:24,476 --> 00:56:28,000
I used some of my old
connections and did some research.

957
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:34,771
Sina Stillwater entering sick leave

958
00:56:34,796 --> 00:56:37,473
June 20th, 2324

959
00:56:37,616 --> 00:56:39,524
ERG Davida, mining operations...

960
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:41,391
I thought we knew all that already?

961
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:43,514
Scroll down.

962
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:50,000
Albio Sengo went back to Earth
for emergency neurological treatment...

963
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
What's the point?

964
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,398
Look at the date!

965
00:56:55,492 --> 00:57:00,303
Scheduled for shuttle
transport June 21st, 2324...

966
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:01,896
What?

967
00:57:02,334 --> 00:57:06,910
He went down to Earth hospital
the day after Sina's procedure?

968
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,000
Isn't that peculiar?

969
00:57:09,286 --> 00:57:10,878
Well, it's the bloody ERG

970
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:12,936
Their records are wrong all the time!

971
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:16,417
I've been in this business long
enough to know when I'm onto something.

972
00:57:16,608 --> 00:57:21,000
The business of making people believe
your stories so they do what you want?

973
00:57:22,268 --> 00:57:25,000
I prefer to call it journalism

974
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:30,000
Albiel was taken to Earth and
that's the place I know my way around.

975
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:32,649
If he's still there, we can find him!

976
00:57:32,688 --> 00:57:35,000
You mean you can find him.

977
00:57:35,211 --> 00:57:39,426
Because I am going
home with my wife and kids.

978
00:57:39,451 --> 00:57:42,153
Plant my lazy ass on the sofa

979
00:57:42,178 --> 00:57:46,095
and stay in precisely that position
for at least half a year!

980
00:57:46,127 --> 00:57:49,733
Aren't you going to resume
your work as a freight carrier pilot?

981
00:57:49,907 --> 00:57:51,271
Maybe eventually.

982
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,631
Take me to Earth, and I'll give you...

983
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,553
This ship!

984
00:58:01,793 --> 00:58:02,793
What?

985
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:04,436
What?

986
00:58:06,547 --> 00:58:07,631
That's a good one!

987
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:14,404
If that's the price for your half of
this rust bucket, feel free to keep it!

988
00:58:16,475 --> 00:58:21,143
I can't take you on Earth on
a stolen ship, not even close!

989
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:24,737
And who says Sina's
going to let you go anyway?

990
00:58:24,775 --> 00:58:28,000
Well, let's see what
she has to say about this

991
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,000
May I?

992
00:58:33,539 --> 00:58:34,539
Hi!

993
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,294
Oh, hey!

994
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,293
Hey, Lyra!

995
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:41,027
I know, I totally forgot
about the rest of the pudding.

996
00:58:41,297 --> 00:58:43,000
I really forgot about it.

997
00:58:43,177 --> 00:58:46,028
I will send someone to pick
the pudding up right away.

998
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,000
Yes, very good, but
that's not why I'm calling.

999
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,344
Oh, what is it then?

1000
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:55,309
I thought you might want to
have a look at this document.

1001
00:58:55,515 --> 00:58:57,605
Sending now.

1002
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:59,498
Oh, ok.

1003
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:05,119
Who?

1004
00:59:05,513 --> 00:59:09,452
Wait, Lyra, you are kidding me!

1005
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:12,070
You're making this up, aren't you?

1006
00:59:12,095 --> 00:59:15,000
Check the flight database, the dates match.

1007
00:59:16,576 --> 00:59:19,013
We can't talk about this online.

1008
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm near the dock.
Hang on, I'm coming over.

1009
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:26,207
I knew she'd bite.

1010
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:29,366
You tricky bitch!

1011
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:34,353
Well, I'm not forcing her to do anything.

1012
00:59:34,378 --> 00:59:36,218
I'm just telling the truth.

1013
00:59:36,726 --> 00:59:40,000
And if it works, it'll be a win-win-win.

1014
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,504
I get back to Earth,
she gets her lover back

1015
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,645
And every day she's not here is
one more day she can't drop the bomb.

1016
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,151
A visitor is requesting entry.

1017
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,000
How? That was fast.

1018
01:00:00,573 --> 01:00:03,207
You little trash panda!

1019
01:00:03,572 --> 01:00:07,744
Where did you get this and why
have you been snooping on me?

1020
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:11,438
I found a back door to
ERG's payroll database.

1021
01:00:11,463 --> 01:00:14,578
Do you even realize what this means to me?

1022
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:16,742
What Albio means to me?

1023
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,714
That is nothing to joke about!

1024
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:21,143
I'm taking it dead seriously.

1025
01:00:21,168 --> 01:00:24,903
Again, why have you been snooping on me?

1026
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:30,000
She wants to go back to Earth, and she
hopes you will somehow make this happen.

1027
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:32,326
Is that true?

1028
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:33,044
Yes.

1029
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:37,190
No, I mean, sort of, but
it's not the whole truth.

1030
01:00:37,225 --> 01:00:41,000
I hate it when people are
trying to play games with me!

1031
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:46,152
Sina, if Albio is still alive on Earth,
I'm sure we can find him for you

1032
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:48,589
If only I could get there...

1033
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:51,072
That sounds too good to be true.

1034
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:54,000
It's just an offer, you decide.

1035
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:57,151
Fair enough.

1036
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:02,774
In fact, I just had an idea.

1037
01:01:03,185 --> 01:01:07,000
Yes, I think I know a way
to make this worthwhile.

1038
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,530
Oh, that's great!

1039
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,421
But you're not going to
go anywhere without me.

1040
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,000
We will be in this together.

1041
01:01:17,228 --> 01:01:20,641
If I get the slightest hint
of you trying to fool me

1042
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:23,314
I am going to bite your head off!

1043
01:01:23,394 --> 01:01:25,705
U ... understood.

1044
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:29,000
I am going to be the
captain of this flight.

1045
01:01:29,631 --> 01:01:31,904
And Sorin is
going to be the pilot.

1046
01:01:32,587 --> 01:01:34,000
No fucking way!

1047
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:37,303
You are the only one I
can trust enough for this.

1048
01:01:37,328 --> 01:01:39,903
Did we really just go
from 'is this even real'

1049
01:01:39,928 --> 01:01:42,884
to 'lets go to Earth' in
less than five seconds?

1050
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:45,944
I said no fucking way!

1051
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:51,050
So we will have to take this ship
to Link Kabanshee to get it rebadged.

1052
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:53,000
Link owes Sorin big time.

1053
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,170
Link Kabanshee?

1054
01:01:54,654 --> 01:01:57,101
That guy is a madman,
he is going to kill me!

1055
01:01:57,783 --> 01:01:59,135
Come with me, Sorin.

1056
01:01:59,556 --> 01:02:03,415
Let me make you an
offer... just between us.

1057
01:02:03,873 --> 01:02:06,748
Lyra, if you would excuse us for a moment?

1058
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:08,887
Is anybody listening to me?

1059
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:13,271
No, is it only over my dead body! Aaaaaa!

1060
01:02:18,183 --> 01:02:20,302
I love politics!

1061
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Ok computer, start recording.
Chapter one, page one.

1062
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:35,737
Affirmative.

1063
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:42,000
As a community of Earth dwelling species,
the sheer scale of space defies our senses.

1064
01:02:42,365 --> 01:02:45,224
On Earth, a full moon
sometimes looks close enough

1065
01:02:45,249 --> 01:02:48,808
to reach out and grab,
sitting low on the horizon.

1066
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,706
But our worldly perception deceives us.

1067
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:56,621
Just a century ago, bridging the
airless chasm between Earth and its moon

1068
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:01,518
barely 230,000 miles
wide, took years of preparation.

1069
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:04,917
And the pioneer who risked
his life to set a paw on its surface

1070
01:03:04,942 --> 01:03:07,727
for the first time became a national hero.

1071
01:03:08,116 --> 01:03:10,926
Fast forward to the
world of today, where a trip

1072
01:03:10,966 --> 01:03:14,000
to the moon is little more
than a casual vacation.

1073
01:03:14,654 --> 01:03:17,109
People long to see the
Earth from space the way

1074
01:03:17,134 --> 01:03:20,581
people used to long to see
the ocean in ancient times.

1075
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:26,000
The final frontier has moved
away from Earth a thousandfold.

1076
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:31,318
Here, not 200,000, but
300 million miles

1077
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:35,000
from home, is where I met
with the pioneers of today.

1078
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:38,922
The only way you get
to experience these vast

1079
01:03:38,946 --> 01:03:42,000
distances is by the time
it takes to travel them.

1080
01:03:42,397 --> 01:03:46,892
Due to the absence of a day and night
cycle, which we have evolved to follow

1081
01:03:46,964 --> 01:03:50,448
As well as the relativistic
nature of space and time

1082
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:54,000
your grasp on the passage of
time will fail you sooner or later.

1083
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:59,461
We're going to be arriving soon
at the decommissioned ERG transport hub

1084
01:03:59,596 --> 01:04:02,396
owned by the system's
most notorious criminal.

1085
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:05,420
And I've already lost
track of how long it's been.

1086
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,939
A day feels like a week, a
week feels like an eternity.

1087
01:04:09,987 --> 01:04:15,000
But wild horses couldn't drag me back
into the cryo chamber I nearly died in.

1088
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:19,520
Computer, stop recording.

1089
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:24,975
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to disturb
you. The door wasn't locked, so I...

1090
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,890
No, no, it's fine. I'm just
trying to pass the time.

1091
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,960
What are you doing?

1092
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,086
Just recording my thoughts.

1093
01:04:32,276 --> 01:04:34,380
I'm trying to make sense of everything.

1094
01:04:34,681 --> 01:04:38,245
If I survive this, maybe
I can turn it into a book.

1095
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:40,718
Once a journalist, always a journalist!

1096
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:42,407
I'm just thinking ahead!

1097
01:04:42,563 --> 01:04:47,221
I lost everything. I'm going to need a way
to earn some money when I'm back on Earth.

1098
01:04:47,948 --> 01:04:49,971
You really are an incurable optimist.

1099
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:52,651
You can be happy if they don't ship
you right back to Vesta.

1100
01:04:52,676 --> 01:04:56,416
Did you just come here to tell me
that? Or is there something else?

1101
01:04:56,441 --> 01:04:57,686
Dinner's ready.

1102
01:04:58,051 --> 01:05:00,404
Let me guess, Beans and Franks?

1103
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:02,465
No, today is mac and cheese day!

1104
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:05,208
On our next trip, I'll do the groceries!

1105
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:07,157
What's wrong with mac and cheese?

1106
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:09,281
Nothing.

1107
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:12,718
How can you not like mac and
cheese? Mac and cheese is the best!

1108
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah, but not five times a week!

1109
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,795
Especially five times a week!

1110
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:19,457
Computer, please put me back into cryosleep.

1111
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:23,817
Unable to comply. Service code 4879

1112
01:05:36,537 --> 01:05:40,067
Uh great, and another interruption.

1113
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:42,803
Hello, can I help you?

1114
01:05:44,076 --> 01:05:46,328
Yeah, my name is Sorin Jax.

1115
01:05:46,364 --> 01:05:49,822
I'd like to talk to Link Kabanshee, please.

1116
01:05:49,919 --> 01:05:51,487
Is it something you need?

1117
01:05:51,998 --> 01:05:56,147
Yeah, well, it's a little software
update we... we need to do, and...

1118
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,138
Well, I've sent a message,
he should be expecting me.

1119
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,718
We're old friends

1120
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:03,769
Friends? Are you certain?

1121
01:06:04,479 --> 01:06:08,148
Yes, we've known each other for years!

1122
01:06:08,322 --> 01:06:09,549
Can you please call him?

1123
01:06:09,574 --> 01:06:13,000
Alright, I'll see he's in the right mood.

1124
01:06:16,063 --> 01:06:18,545
Shit! Not in the right mood!
Not in the right mood!

1125
01:06:21,763 --> 01:06:22,911
Sorin, Lyra, take cover!

1126
01:06:22,936 --> 01:06:26,000
No, Sina, it's fine, I'll handle this.

1127
01:06:28,206 --> 01:06:31,206
Hey Link, old buddy, good to see you!

1128
01:06:34,372 --> 01:06:39,372
You got some nerve showing up
here like this, you son of a bitch!

1129
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:49,165
Link, can we please just talk?

1130
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:57,674
And may I remind you that we are inside
a pressurized cabin in the middle of space!

1131
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1132
01:07:04,273 --> 01:07:07,000
Brian? Brian!

1133
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:10,160
Come here and put some
tape on that hole, will ya?

1134
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:16,000
Hurry up, Brian! Hop, hop, hop, hop!

1135
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:23,480
Now come out and tell me
what you want, you coward!

1136
01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:29,250
Hey Link, it's me, Sorin!

1137
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:32,242
The guy who saved your life, remember?

1138
01:07:32,267 --> 01:07:37,899
Of course I remember you, my hero!

1139
01:07:37,947 --> 01:07:41,423
It was 15 fighter ships against us two!

1140
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:42,772
Yes.

1141
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:45,386
And they would be
my fighter ships now

1142
01:07:45,411 --> 01:07:50,217
if you hadn't decided to
save me, fucking idiot!

1143
01:07:50,828 --> 01:07:52,523
Better let me do the talking.

1144
01:07:52,548 --> 01:07:54,493
No, no, I can handle this!

1145
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:59,234
Hi, we have got this
nice new ship out there.

1146
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:02,528
Unfortunately, we're in
trouble with the previous owner

1147
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,958
and we need our
ID transponder changed.

1148
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:09,264
My lady, you do know
that's highly illegal, don't you?

1149
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:14,108
Yeah, the moment I came
here I knew we would fit right in.

1150
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:19,056
Re-batching some old
space taxi, that's one thing.

1151
01:08:19,135 --> 01:08:22,649
What you've got out there
is a brand new Rhino Mark IV

1152
01:08:22,674 --> 01:08:25,134
 that will require
some special attention.

1153
01:08:25,618 --> 01:08:28,597
And even if it works,
it's so new and shiny

1154
01:08:28,622 --> 01:08:31,443
it will stick out like a sore
thumb wherever you go!

1155
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:33,526
So, can you do it?

1156
01:08:34,438 --> 01:08:40,321
The question is not if I can do it.
The question is, can you afford it?

1157
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:53,519
My lady, you are my new favorite customer!

1158
01:08:53,544 --> 01:08:59,764
Brian! Get the data cable and the
Rhino adapter, we've got some work to do.

1159
01:09:00,405 --> 01:09:05,640
Brian do this, Brian do that, next time
you're putting your socks on yourself!

1160
01:09:05,743 --> 01:09:07,000
What?

1161
01:09:07,232 --> 01:09:09,000
Get me clear, eh?

1162
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:11,011
Christically!

1163
01:09:11,407 --> 01:09:15,810
We'll have to make a backup with your main
computer, perform a complete memory wipe

1164
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:18,099
and then reinstall it with a new identity.

1165
01:09:18,124 --> 01:09:22,341
In order to do that, the entire ship
must be completely powered down.

1166
01:09:23,143 --> 01:09:25,000
Including the reactor?

1167
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,480
Especially the reactor.

1168
01:09:28,403 --> 01:09:33,000
Alright, I'll take care of that, you'll be
able to reach me through my comms.

1169
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,531
So, how long is this going to take?

1170
01:09:38,556 --> 01:09:43,784
Ahh, not long. Getting nervous
outside of your little comfort zone?

1171
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:46,000
What do you mean?

1172
01:09:46,246 --> 01:09:49,369
I know who you are, and
you are not exactly known

1173
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:53,000
for leaving your ivory
tower, 'Mrs. Stillwater'.

1174
01:09:53,896 --> 01:10:00,076
Yes, me being out here better
stays our little secret, 'Mr. Kabanshee'.

1175
01:10:00,346 --> 01:10:04,000
Do I look like I want to paint
a huge red target on my ass?

1176
01:10:06,534 --> 01:10:08,826
We have more customers incoming, Link.

1177
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:12,000
Are you sure? I'm not expecting anyone.

1178
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,080
What kind of ship?

1179
01:10:13,151 --> 01:10:15,659
I can't say yet. They're
not transmitting an ID

1180
01:10:15,684 --> 01:10:17,904
and they're not close
enough for anything visual

1181
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:21,068
I hate it when people
come in without warning!

1182
01:10:21,203 --> 01:10:23,724
Send them to pad B, and
no service until we know

1183
01:10:23,749 --> 01:10:25,911
who they are and what
they want, you hear me?

1184
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:28,000
As always.

1185
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,941
Sina, you getting me?

1186
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:37,000
Yep

1187
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:40,000
Reactor's powered down,
computer's in recovery mode.

1188
01:10:40,511 --> 01:10:42,878
Alright, Brian's gonna
start the upload now.

1189
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:45,019
Don't touch anything!

1190
01:10:45,114 --> 01:10:51,270
If the transfer gets interrupted, your CPU
is going to be one expensive piece of trash.

1191
01:10:51,412 --> 01:10:53,000
Gotcha.

1192
01:10:58,618 --> 01:11:02,000
Link, the ship's not
answering, anything in mind?

1193
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:06,000
Hail them one more time,
then set off some fireworks.

1194
01:11:06,634 --> 01:11:08,000
Very well.

1195
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,678
Sounds like there is trouble brewing.

1196
01:11:10,703 --> 01:11:14,515
Nah, not really. Every few months
some idiot thinks

1197
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:18,951
just because we're not under Earth law,
they can raid us like the local 7-11.

1198
01:11:18,976 --> 01:11:21,000
We are well prepared for that.

1199
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:27,798
What the hell's going on out there?

1200
01:11:27,823 --> 01:11:30,741
Just some unregistered
ship getting too close.

1201
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:36,000
Until the update's done, we're deaf,
blind and completely defenseless.

1202
01:11:36,162 --> 01:11:38,000
How far are we?

1203
01:11:39,126 --> 01:11:41,126
20%

1204
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:48,959
What the fuck was that?

1205
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,687
I will try to find out, just hang in there!

1206
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:52,730
Alright!

1207
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,792
It's a freaking M-class Yellowjacket!

1208
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:02,865
No external markings, and
they're melting our turrets!

1209
01:12:02,896 --> 01:12:04,869
Fuck, that's no ordinary raid.

1210
01:12:04,894 --> 01:12:07,000
Oh great!

1211
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,874
They're preparing to land on Pad C!

1212
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,203
Sound the alarm and
batten down the hatches.

1213
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:13,109
If they want to talk, we will talk.

1214
01:12:13,188 --> 01:12:16,000
If they try to invade,
initiate Sequence Red.

1215
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:17,763
Sequence Red?

1216
01:12:17,827 --> 01:12:20,000
Yes, Sequence Red.

1217
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Who are these people?

1218
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I don't know, and I
don't want to find out!

1219
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Sorin, come in!

1220
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:37,342
What's going on down there?

1221
01:12:37,445 --> 01:12:40,270
The station is being attacked
by an unmarked fighter ship.

1222
01:12:40,537 --> 01:12:42,614
We need to get out of here ASAP!

1223
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:44,350
How far is the upload?

1224
01:12:45,054 --> 01:12:45,940
30%

1225
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:48,000
Thirty? Oh shit!

1226
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,094
Who's the target, the station or us?

1227
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:51,673
I wish I knew.

1228
01:12:51,698 --> 01:12:54,140
Link, what's Sequence Red?

1229
01:12:54,165 --> 01:12:56,705
Evacuation, then self-destruction.

1230
01:12:56,888 --> 01:13:00,000
Not gonna let anybody see
the skeletons in my closet.

1231
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:05,255
Can we postpone Armageddon until
after our ship is back online, please?

1232
01:13:09,269 --> 01:13:11,366
I think we have a touchdown.

1233
01:13:17,896 --> 01:13:19,092
The ship has landed!

1234
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:21,000
Cargo bay just opened!

1235
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:23,000
People in armored suits are pouring out!

1236
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,745
20, 50, maybe 100!

1237
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:28,392
Ah shit, these guys
aren't here for negotiations.

1238
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:30,598
Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate!

1239
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,000
Well, there goes the workshop...

1240
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,880
Come on, follow me, this way!

1241
01:13:36,218 --> 01:13:39,658
No, we have to make sure
that the update gets through

1242
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:42,071
Or Sorin will be stuck here with the enemy!

1243
01:13:42,388 --> 01:13:44,000
Sorin, come in!

1244
01:13:46,747 --> 01:13:48,540
Tell me the good news first.

1245
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:50,221
No good news, I'm afraid.

1246
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:52,179
The station is being invaded.

1247
01:13:52,258 --> 01:13:53,512
The crew is evacuating.

1248
01:13:53,537 --> 01:13:55,000
How far are we?

1249
01:13:55,796 --> 01:13:57,000
40%

1250
01:13:58,797 --> 01:14:03,183
Link, is it possible to hold this
hangar for just a few more minutes?

1251
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:06,000
This station is a workshop, not a bunker!

1252
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Freeze! Hands behind your head, now!

1253
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:18,230
Here, defend yourself!

1254
01:14:30,706 --> 01:14:33,272
Link, close the fire door, quick!

1255
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,380
Shit, shit!

1256
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:48,807
Upload is at 50%

1257
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,975
Oh, Link, how bad is it?

1258
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
It's really bad!

1259
01:14:57,472 --> 01:14:59,935
I'm hearing strange
noises through the hull.

1260
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:02,000
I think they're trying to break in!

1261
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,082
What the hell are these
guys even looking for?

1262
01:15:06,516 --> 01:15:07,959
They're not mucking around!

1263
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:12,263
Lyra, put your helmet on, now!

1264
01:15:14,698 --> 01:15:18,270
Upload is at 60%

1265
01:15:19,157 --> 01:15:21,669
Do you think you can
make it back to the ship?

1266
01:15:22,557 --> 01:15:24,000
No idea!

1267
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:29,479
It's just a few meters, but no cover...

1268
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:36,224
No! We're losing pressure!

1269
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:40,134
I... I can't breathe...

1270
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:42,438
Help me!

1271
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:46,125
Link, over there, the ATV!

1272
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:47,249
The what?

1273
01:15:47,274 --> 01:15:50,452
The exploration vehicle,
it's got a pressurized cabin.

1274
01:15:50,477 --> 01:15:53,746
It's a complete wreck, how
do we know it's still sealed?

1275
01:15:53,881 --> 01:15:55,780
Shut up and help me!

1276
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:04,572
Upload at 70%

1277
01:16:09,587 --> 01:16:10,347
Sorin!

1278
01:16:10,372 --> 01:16:10,850
Yes?

1279
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:13,000
They're trying to bust through the airlock.

1280
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,724
If that happens, we're
going to make a run for it.

1281
01:16:15,749 --> 01:16:16,083
Okay...

1282
01:16:16,108 --> 01:16:19,455
I want you to open the cargo
door as soon as possible.

1283
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,368
What if anybody else gets in?

1284
01:16:21,393 --> 01:16:24,203
That's going to be the least
of our problems, trust me!

1285
01:16:24,228 --> 01:16:26,613
What about Link? Are we going to carry him?

1286
01:16:26,638 --> 01:16:31,010
Our first priority is to secure
the computer and get away

1287
01:16:31,082 --> 01:16:32,415
before the station blows up!

1288
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,054
But we can't just leave him
here! Does the vehicle still work?

1289
01:16:37,206 --> 01:16:38,206
80%

1290
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,204
It's got a new motor, but no main reactor.

1291
01:16:41,696 --> 01:16:43,892
Then tell me where I can find one!

1292
01:16:44,537 --> 01:16:45,365
Lyra?

1293
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:49,759
Lyra, look for exploration equipment
that's often built to be power independent.

1294
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,201
Something, like the thing up there?

1295
01:16:56,226 --> 01:16:58,000
Sorin, what do you say?

1296
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,726
Hold your camera still.

1297
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:00,716
What?

1298
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:04,808
No, no, that's way too big, you
could power a small ship with that.

1299
01:17:04,856 --> 01:17:06,756
That means it's perfect!

1300
01:17:07,301 --> 01:17:08,301
What?

1301
01:17:09,437 --> 01:17:10,370
Alright.

1302
01:17:10,706 --> 01:17:11,706
Now.

1303
01:17:12,571 --> 01:17:15,571
Crane moving left...

1304
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,191
Yeah...

1305
01:17:19,216 --> 01:17:20,393
Okay, okay, okay

1306
01:17:20,418 --> 01:17:21,418
And stop!

1307
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,064
Down...

1308
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,408
Is here...

1309
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:27,698
Okay...

1310
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:29,125
Okay...

1311
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,598
Okay, catching on!

1312
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:34,230
Okay.

1313
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:36,444
And...

1314
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:38,133
Moving to the right...

1315
01:17:38,428 --> 01:17:39,428
Come on...

1316
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Does it work?

1317
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,270
Okay...

1318
01:17:42,888 --> 01:17:43,888
Okay...

1319
01:17:45,357 --> 01:17:47,590
Yeah, okay, slowly...

1320
01:17:47,681 --> 01:17:49,281
Slowly...

1321
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:53,252
Fuck!

1322
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:55,498
That was the outer door of the airlock!

1323
01:17:55,808 --> 01:17:57,602
One more blast and they are through!

1324
01:17:57,627 --> 01:17:59,627
Get in the car, Lyra, quick!

1325
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:06,000
Upload at...

1326
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,275
99%

1327
01:18:08,412 --> 01:18:11,412
It stopped moving at fucking 99%

1328
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:15,000
Come on, you piece of shit!

1329
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Load, load, load, load!

1330
01:18:21,206 --> 01:18:23,825
I need more time to load the crane!

1331
01:18:26,413 --> 01:18:28,413
I need more time, Sina!

1332
01:18:31,848 --> 01:18:33,176
Just drop the thing!

1333
01:18:33,201 --> 01:18:37,000
On 3, 2, 1, now!

1334
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Quick!

1335
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,304
100%!

1336
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:49,000
Powering on!

1337
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:51,190
Step on it for fuck's sake!

1338
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:10,719
Whoa, hello!

1339
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:13,537
Holy shit, what the hell was that?

1340
01:19:15,522 --> 01:19:17,000
Yes, yes, what is it?

1341
01:19:17,146 --> 01:19:19,457
Sergeant Baker, this is Ricky Maturo.

1342
01:19:19,482 --> 01:19:20,728
I'm on sentry duty.

1343
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,330
We have an anomaly!

1344
01:19:22,355 --> 01:19:24,000
Yeah, I know who you are.

1345
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
What kind of anomaly?

1346
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:29,626
Transient electromagnetic
disturbance of magnitude

1347
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:33,724
F5+, followed by a hell
of a gamma ray burst.

1348
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:35,374
That's a doozy.

1349
01:19:35,612 --> 01:19:36,838
What's the location?

1350
01:19:36,863 --> 01:19:39,502
Blast was so strong, it's
bouncing all over the place.

1351
01:19:39,527 --> 01:19:43,256
I've tasked the deep space network to help
cut through the reflections and triangulate.

1352
01:19:43,462 --> 01:19:47,140
And that's confirmed, sector 4489

1353
01:19:47,465 --> 01:19:48,551
Man, that was fast.

1354
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:50,390
Did one of our ships report in?

1355
01:19:50,605 --> 01:19:53,107
No, no, we don't have
a mandate for that area.

1356
01:19:53,225 --> 01:19:54,749
It's the wild, wild west out there.

1357
01:19:54,774 --> 01:19:58,782
No, everyone in the system
saw this, whatever it was.

1358
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:00,746
Must have been spectacular!

1359
01:20:00,771 --> 01:20:03,685
Well, if someone's drive
blew up, you bet it was.

1360
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:06,013
Oh, you're thinking engine detonation?

1361
01:20:06,038 --> 01:20:07,515
Well, let's see.

1362
01:20:07,832 --> 01:20:11,617
Closest match is a
decommissioned ERG transport hub

1363
01:20:11,784 --> 01:20:13,909
Registered to Dynamo Trading Limited.

1364
01:20:13,957 --> 01:20:15,771
Man, that's Link Kabanshee!

1365
01:20:16,334 --> 01:20:17,411
Who's that now?

1366
01:20:17,436 --> 01:20:19,451
I keep forgetting, you're pretty new here.

1367
01:20:19,476 --> 01:20:21,206
Link Kabanshee's a legend.

1368
01:20:21,231 --> 01:20:23,688
Stinking rich, and... kind of a wild one.

1369
01:20:23,713 --> 01:20:27,648
After the station's decommissioning,
the sector lost its controlled space status

1370
01:20:27,673 --> 01:20:33,216
And, well, he saw that as a perfect opportunity
to set up his own personal tax haven.

1371
01:20:33,534 --> 01:20:36,866
Well, in that case, it's a miracle
he didn't get blown up earlier.

1372
01:20:36,891 --> 01:20:38,560
Hm, you'd think so, huh?

1373
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:40,366
Well, he's got a lot of
friends in high places

1374
01:20:40,391 --> 01:20:44,281
And, you know, according to his
reputation, he's pretty much untouchable.

1375
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,806
Uh, if these records are still up to date

1376
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:50,000
His reactor's been due for
replacement for five years!

1377
01:20:50,067 --> 01:20:51,331
Well, there you have it.

1378
01:20:51,356 --> 01:20:53,435
Maybe we're just
overthinking the whole issue.

1379
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:55,090
Could have just been an accident.

1380
01:20:55,115 --> 01:20:57,636
Oh, it's going to be an interesting
investigation, that's for sure!

1381
01:20:57,661 --> 01:20:59,931
Uh, what investigation?

1382
01:21:00,129 --> 01:21:04,197
There's a nuclear explosion in space,
and we're not going to investigate?

1383
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,129
Heh, like you said, rookie:

1384
01:21:06,312 --> 01:21:07,684
Wild, wild west.

1385
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:11,277
Where you're pretty much free
to blow yourself up as you wish.

1386
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:13,803
The investigation bureau's
just going to look at the data

1387
01:21:13,828 --> 01:21:15,234
Confirm the nature of the explosion

1388
01:21:15,259 --> 01:21:17,212
And that's pretty much it.

1389
01:21:17,237 --> 01:21:18,723
I mean, what are we supposed to do?

1390
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:20,101
There's nothing left to look at

1391
01:21:20,126 --> 01:21:21,797
And if there's no one there to be rescued

1392
01:21:21,822 --> 01:21:25,207
It's not really our job to
waste any tax money on it.

1393
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:27,460
That's the whole point
of uncontrolled space.

1394
01:21:27,485 --> 01:21:30,951
Uh, hold up, sir, I'm picking
up a ship leaving the area.

1395
01:21:30,976 --> 01:21:33,580
SpaceX, Rhino, Mark IV

1396
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:35,292
They've responded to hails on CommNet

1397
01:21:35,317 --> 01:21:37,000
And they say they're fine.

1398
01:21:37,494 --> 01:21:39,467
They claim they're about to deliver

1399
01:21:39,618 --> 01:21:41,647
Some chocolate pudding?

1400
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,822
Whatever the hell that's code for.

1401
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:45,343
Got struck by some shrapnel

1402
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:47,242
But it scraped some paint, nothing more.

1403
01:21:47,267 --> 01:21:49,648
Heh, chocolate pudding?

1404
01:21:50,346 --> 01:21:51,761
Right, okay.

1405
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:52,920
Well, whatever.

1406
01:21:52,945 --> 01:21:56,000
I wouldn't be surprised if
Link himself is on that ship.

1407
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,538
You think we'll ever find out?

1408
01:21:57,563 --> 01:21:59,000
Eh, probably not

1409
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,132
And it's not really our business anyway.

1410
01:22:01,157 --> 01:22:03,319
Let's just file the report
and be done with it.

1411
01:22:03,367 --> 01:22:04,157
Understood, sir.

1412
01:22:04,182 --> 01:22:06,182
Ricky Maturo out.

1413
01:22:18,197 --> 01:22:21,371
Hey, didn't your mom teach you any manners?

1414
01:22:21,396 --> 01:22:22,396
Nope!

1415
01:22:28,169 --> 01:22:30,974
Oh, stop it, that's disgusting!

1416
01:22:30,999 --> 01:22:33,855
In space, nobody can hear you belch.

1417
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:38,243
Yeah, just wait.

1418
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:41,386
Just wait until we enter the control zone.

1419
01:22:41,743 --> 01:22:44,570
Under Earth legislation,
manners are strictly enforced.

1420
01:22:44,657 --> 01:22:46,589
Ha! Maybe.

1421
01:22:46,614 --> 01:22:48,548
But first they gotta catch me.

1422
01:22:48,573 --> 01:22:50,247
Do you hear me, Earthlings?

1423
01:22:50,272 --> 01:22:52,608
The pioneers are coming!

1424
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,403
Stop, stop, stop, guys, guys

1425
01:23:02,428 --> 01:23:04,428
This might be important, okay?

1426
01:23:08,539 --> 01:23:10,717
Ah, we are about to enter control space.

1427
01:23:10,742 --> 01:23:12,712
I'll be on the bridge
getting us checked in.

1428
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:14,527
Keep your claws crossed they'll let us.

1429
01:23:15,385 --> 01:23:16,426
They will.

1430
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,998
Your new certificates
should be cryptographically

1431
01:23:19,022 --> 01:23:21,101
indistinguishable
from the real thing!

1432
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Let's hope so, by goodness!

1433
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:28,355
I would bet my station
on it if I still had one.

1434
01:23:30,349 --> 01:23:34,062
Well, I'm still amazed how
easy you're taking your loss.

1435
01:23:35,084 --> 01:23:40,000
Well, I knew I might have
to blow it up eventually

1436
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,481
Why would I install a self-destruct
if I wasn't prepared to use it?

1437
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,507
You are a lot richer
than you look, aren't you?

1438
01:23:49,505 --> 01:23:51,792
It's a bit more complicated than that...

1439
01:23:51,817 --> 01:23:53,595
Oh, is it?

1440
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:58,432
I could tell you, but then I would
have to blow your ship up too.

1441
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:02,436
And what happens with your business now?

1442
01:24:02,461 --> 01:24:04,000
Ah, we will have to relocate.

1443
01:24:04,677 --> 01:24:06,000
No shit.

1444
01:24:07,578 --> 01:24:10,363
The workshop was just
a fancy branch office.

1445
01:24:10,388 --> 01:24:13,918
The stuff that really brings
in the money is all digital.

1446
01:24:13,943 --> 01:24:16,975
And I have more than
just one backup, believe me.

1447
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:19,133
Any idea who attacked us?

1448
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:20,324
Nope.

1449
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,917
Some kind of UN black ops?

1450
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:25,461
I don't think so.

1451
01:24:25,486 --> 01:24:29,583
The military has been secretly
buying spare parts from me for ages.

1452
01:24:29,622 --> 01:24:31,787
We always had a great relationship.

1453
01:24:33,342 --> 01:24:35,858
Could it have anything to do with us?

1454
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,000
Sina, who else knows you're on this ship?

1455
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,650
Nobody, I swear.

1456
01:24:40,779 --> 01:24:43,397
Maybe they were after Trent Binkin.

1457
01:24:43,691 --> 01:24:45,222
But he's dead.

1458
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:51,224
Well, all they know is that the ship left
Juno Station and the bomb didn't explode.

1459
01:24:51,454 --> 01:24:55,630
Wait a minute, who is Trent Binkin?

1460
01:24:55,765 --> 01:24:59,000
Who are they and what bomb didn't explode?

1461
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:03,291
He's a secret agent sent by
Earth who tried to smuggle a fucking

1462
01:25:03,315 --> 01:25:07,644
 SDC-4 anti-matter
bomb onto my station

1463
01:25:08,176 --> 01:25:09,493
SD?

1464
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:11,000
Stillwater Dynamics?

1465
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,352
Yeah, isn't it ironic?

1466
01:25:13,377 --> 01:25:16,286
It has my goddamn family name on it!

1467
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:18,436
With love from mom.

1468
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:20,771
That really doesn't mean anything.

1469
01:25:21,604 --> 01:25:24,466
It narrows it down to a
UN source at the very least.

1470
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:28,265
What happened to that Binkin guy again?

1471
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:30,149
I shot the motherfucker.

1472
01:25:30,174 --> 01:25:32,429
The defenseless motherfucker!

1473
01:25:33,444 --> 01:25:35,483
Hey, which side are you on?

1474
01:25:35,508 --> 01:25:37,270
He wanted to kill us all!

1475
01:25:37,295 --> 01:25:40,000
And now we're never
going to know who sent him!

1476
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:43,787
Did he carry any ID?

1477
01:25:43,812 --> 01:25:48,860
What, like his secret
secret agent travel passport?

1478
01:25:48,885 --> 01:25:52,060
I got his tablet, but it's encrypted.

1479
01:25:52,085 --> 01:25:55,782
Latest gen. Tried
everything, it's hopeless.

1480
01:25:55,807 --> 01:25:57,213
Can I see it?

1481
01:25:57,238 --> 01:25:58,504
Uh sure.

1482
01:26:07,443 --> 01:26:11,274
Can you get me a diagnostics
cable? There is something I want to try.

1483
01:26:12,045 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah, sure, hang on.

1484
01:26:15,531 --> 01:26:18,151
What are you going to do?

1485
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:21,433
Why, unlock this thing of course.

1486
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:28,000
But how?

1487
01:26:29,092 --> 01:26:33,937
Do you think the UN would allow
personal devices they can't unlock?

1488
01:26:33,968 --> 01:26:38,000
I always thought it was
just a conspiracy theory.

1489
01:26:40,889 --> 01:26:45,344
Just because you're not paranoid
doesn't mean they're not after you.

1490
01:26:55,194 --> 01:26:57,000
Here, there you go.

1491
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,263
Thank you!

1492
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:09,683
The Bangenator version 93.332
is licensed under the GPL V12

1493
01:27:12,157 --> 01:27:14,272
Let's see...

1494
01:27:14,297 --> 01:27:16,425
Scanning for passwords...

1495
01:27:21,674 --> 01:27:23,196
Access denied.

1496
01:27:24,174 --> 01:27:25,205
Damn it!

1497
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:27,244
Scanning for passwords...

1498
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:32,000
Maybe like this...

1499
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,890
Device unlocked.

1500
01:27:34,423 --> 01:27:37,563
Oh, it's that easy? Holy crap!

1501
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:40,197
Alright...

1502
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,000
Now...

1503
01:27:44,907 --> 01:27:49,649
Show me your address book
and I will tell you who you are.

1504
01:27:50,634 --> 01:27:52,000
Let's see...

1505
01:27:52,241 --> 01:27:53,743
Not much on here...

1506
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:57,347
No personal contacts,
only a few proxy addresses.

1507
01:27:57,372 --> 01:28:00,000
Ship maintenance software, crypto stuff...

1508
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,317
Maps, location history starts on Earth.

1509
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,093
This thing is still online!

1510
01:28:11,243 --> 01:28:13,072
And we just got a message.

1511
01:28:13,302 --> 01:28:16,795
From First National Credit.

1512
01:28:16,922 --> 01:28:19,000
A chargeback!

1513
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,325
"We are sorry to inform you that our system
has detected a fraudulent transaction."

1514
01:28:24,753 --> 01:28:27,000
Wow, that's quite a sum!

1515
01:28:27,165 --> 01:28:31,000
Initiated by some Attila B. Shamir.

1516
01:28:32,346 --> 01:28:37,194
It might be probably too late, but maybe
you should take the tablet off the network

1517
01:28:37,311 --> 01:28:41,221
Oh shit, they could have been
tracking us with this device all along.

1518
01:28:41,443 --> 01:28:43,000
Why didn't I think of this?

1519
01:28:43,863 --> 01:28:45,574
Typical beginner's mistake.

1520
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,685
Now, who is Attila Shamir?

1521
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,000
Oh, I know him!

1522
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
He's the Chief Security Officer at
the Extraplanetary Resources Group.

1523
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,584
We used to be golf buddies.

1524
01:28:56,609 --> 01:28:58,000
What?

1525
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yes, it's a long story.

1526
01:29:03,787 --> 01:29:08,429
So Binkin wasn't on the
military's payroll, but on ERG's.

1527
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,322
But does that make sense?

1528
01:29:10,385 --> 01:29:12,561
We are not at war with the ERG!

1529
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:17,261
The worst thing we've ever done
to them is squat a few derelict bases.

1530
01:29:17,578 --> 01:29:20,742
Maybe it is time to change perspective.

1531
01:29:20,869 --> 01:29:26,000
On Earth, you're not seen as
much of a threat by anybody.

1532
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:29,592
In the asteroid belt, however,
it's a different situation.

1533
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:32,800
Out there, ERG is not just a company.

1534
01:29:32,895 --> 01:29:38,000
It's an empire built on the
exploitation of cheap labor.

1535
01:29:38,438 --> 01:29:42,000
And Juno Station is a
socialist utopia in comparison.

1536
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:44,765
And their only competition is you.

1537
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:49,000
They've been pressuring the UN to strike
against Juno for years without success

1538
01:29:49,599 --> 01:29:53,740
I wouldn't be surprised if they decided
to take things into their own hands.

1539
01:29:53,975 --> 01:29:56,975
We are still Earth's
most significant opposition.

1540
01:29:57,147 --> 01:29:59,741
Earth is more than just the UN.

1541
01:29:59,804 --> 01:30:03,402
Well, everyone is entitled
to their own opinion.

1542
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:10,328
Attention, we cleared
the checkpoint and we're

1543
01:30:10,353 --> 01:30:12,727
now preparing to
enter our assigned orbit.

1544
01:30:12,783 --> 01:30:14,877
I want to keep our
visit as short as possible.

1545
01:30:14,902 --> 01:30:16,854
So the next burn we'll pack a few more G's

1546
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:19,473
Then our internal gravity
can compensate for

1547
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:22,563
So hold on to your drinks, over and out.

1548
01:30:25,142 --> 01:30:28,435
No matter what, we are
in controlled space now.

1549
01:30:28,776 --> 01:30:31,352
Whoever is after this ship can't attack us

1550
01:30:31,377 --> 01:30:34,109
Without attracting a
lot of unwanted attention.

1551
01:30:34,545 --> 01:30:37,086
They might try to get at us personally

1552
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:40,000
But, well, that's a risk we'll have to take

1553
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,367
So let's go in and see if we can find Albio

1554
01:30:43,478 --> 01:30:46,000
And get out again as fast as possible

1555
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,778
Where are we going to touch down?

1556
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,000
Stockholm.

1557
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Nice!

1558
01:30:51,247 --> 01:30:55,000
The Karolinska University
Hospital in Stockholm to be precise.

1559
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:58,091
It was the last known
whereabouts of Albio Sengo

1560
01:30:58,116 --> 01:31:01,000
After he was shipped from
Davida for medical treatment.

1561
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And what is your plan?

1562
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Find out where he went from there...

1563
01:31:05,444 --> 01:31:07,426
You sound pretty confident.

1564
01:31:07,688 --> 01:31:10,649
I know how Earthers tick, trust me.

1565
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,000
There's almost nothing you can't find out

1566
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,151
With some good old social engineering.

1567
01:31:16,191 --> 01:31:17,975
Social what?

1568
01:31:18,154 --> 01:31:20,801
Did you ever play pretend
when you were little?

1569
01:31:20,826 --> 01:31:22,881
It's a bit like that.

1570
01:31:22,906 --> 01:31:25,558
Of course, in fact, I've
never quit playing it.

1571
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:26,960
I'm all in!

1572
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I was way too busy
becoming my foster parents'

1573
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Perfect little toy soldier!

1574
01:31:33,366 --> 01:31:36,721
Wow, that was unexpected.

1575
01:31:36,776 --> 01:31:40,605
Adopting me saved them from
getting a birth license of their own.

1576
01:31:40,701 --> 01:31:45,096
The older I got, the more they
treated me like I'm their property

1577
01:31:45,682 --> 01:31:49,647
I'm sorry, I'm so happy to be finally home.

1578
01:31:49,742 --> 01:31:52,354
I forgot how different it is for you.

1579
01:31:52,561 --> 01:31:55,051
I can't wait to be back on Earth.

1580
01:31:55,329 --> 01:31:57,364
I could be in a different galaxy

1581
01:31:57,510 --> 01:32:00,689
And I would still be closer
to home than I am here!

1582
01:32:02,441 --> 01:32:04,505
Sorry to interrupt your afternoon coffee

1583
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:07,667
I just got the time and
coordinates for our shuttle.

1584
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:11,000
I hope you don't mind I'm not
trying to land this unwieldy thing.

1585
01:32:11,315 --> 01:32:13,309
You'll have to go through
immigration at the spaceport

1586
01:32:13,334 --> 01:32:16,714
so keep your cryptographically
indistinguishable certificates ready.

1587
01:32:18,085 --> 01:32:20,653
Oh, and prepare for orbit insertion

1588
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:26,000
In 4, 3, 2, 1, go!

1589
01:32:26,724 --> 01:32:29,000
Oh shit, here it comes.

1590
01:32:35,395 --> 01:32:40,423
This was so much easier
when I still had a spine!

1591
01:33:02,464 --> 01:33:05,741
Dr. Ilva, to the central
sterile services Department.

1592
01:33:05,766 --> 01:33:07,406
Dr. Ilva, please.

1593
01:33:10,464 --> 01:33:16,000
Okay, so, what was our plan again?

1594
01:33:16,622 --> 01:33:20,000
The key to successful
social engineering is to fit in.

1595
01:33:20,175 --> 01:33:22,076
You have to make it
look like you're the right

1596
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,642
guy in the right place
doing the right thing.

1597
01:33:24,769 --> 01:33:27,000
And nobody will even question it!

1598
01:33:27,172 --> 01:33:31,482
So, the first thing you
do is sit down and observe.

1599
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,000
Alright.

1600
01:33:33,496 --> 01:33:36,794
Dr. Ilva, to the central
sterile services Department.

1601
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:40,480
Dr. Ilva, where the hell are
you? We need you up here!

1602
01:33:40,607 --> 01:33:45,070
Yes, yes, I'm coming,
the bus was late, I'm sorry.

1603
01:33:51,957 --> 01:33:57,189
If you have seen Dr. Ilva, please send her
to the central sterile services Department.

1604
01:33:57,348 --> 01:34:00,060
Does anybody know if
she still works at this place?

1605
01:34:00,085 --> 01:34:03,000
Does this thing even work?

1606
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,656
Hello? Hello?

1607
01:34:06,082 --> 01:34:08,850
I'm coming, for heaven's sake!

1608
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:21,942
Hmm, very interesting.

1609
01:34:24,482 --> 01:34:26,749
Oh my god, we're losing him! Septic shock!

1610
01:34:26,774 --> 01:34:31,000
Give him an amp of epi, a mig of atropine,
1.5 of each Erythro and Cefotaxime!

1611
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,703
Get him into the trauma room! A04 is free!

1612
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,622
What's going on?

1613
01:34:34,647 --> 01:34:35,398
He crashed!

1614
01:34:35,423 --> 01:34:38,844
From bradycardic at 35
to flatline. Temp's 35.5.

1615
01:34:38,907 --> 01:34:40,901
We're stimulating his heart.

1616
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:42,161
Epi and atropine on board.

1617
01:34:42,186 --> 01:34:43,338
Any heart sounds?

1618
01:34:43,363 --> 01:34:44,054
Negative.

1619
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:45,393
Piggyback an Isuprel drip!

1620
01:34:45,418 --> 01:34:46,867
No, wait, I got a pulse.

1621
01:34:46,892 --> 01:34:47,790
He's in V-tach.

1622
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:48,701
What the hell?

1623
01:34:48,726 --> 01:34:51,000
Hold the Isuprel now,
and give him Lidocaine!

1624
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
50 milligrams, IV push!

1625
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,085
His heart is racing!

1626
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:54,613
Why?

1627
01:34:54,638 --> 01:34:56,000
I don't know!

1628
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,205
Let's get the 12-lead in
there and see what's going on.

1629
01:34:58,230 --> 01:34:59,230
Move it!

1630
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:05,920
What the?

1631
01:35:06,259 --> 01:35:11,000
There we go, I've seen
everything I need to see.

1632
01:35:11,262 --> 01:35:13,777
Uh, whatever that might have been

1633
01:35:13,896 --> 01:35:18,333
You gotta look the part, act the part,
and don't give them any time to think

1634
01:35:18,405 --> 01:35:20,817
And they'll even hold
the door open for you.

1635
01:35:20,842 --> 01:35:22,000
You'll see!

1636
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:27,156
Now, do you think you can
open one of those lockers for us?

1637
01:35:28,243 --> 01:35:30,000
Uh, sure.

1638
01:35:30,428 --> 01:35:32,000
Let me have a look here...

1639
01:35:47,928 --> 01:35:48,928
There!

1640
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:52,362
Then, let's get dressed.

1641
01:36:00,734 --> 01:36:03,000
Oh, oh, jeez

1642
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:04,633
This is...

1643
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:08,000
Ow, aw, can you get off my tail, please?

1644
01:36:08,283 --> 01:36:10,000
Lyra, is that you?

1645
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,679
Sina, could you give that back to me?

1646
01:36:14,704 --> 01:36:17,115
Is that your foot, Sorin, or is it your...

1647
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:19,000
Sorry, I thought it was mine.

1648
01:36:20,071 --> 01:36:21,713
What's this smoke?

1649
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
What's that on my back, jeez?

1650
01:36:25,447 --> 01:36:28,000
This smells like someone had bean soup.

1651
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,461
Sorin!

1652
01:36:30,857 --> 01:36:31,857
Ow, ow, ow

1653
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
What are you doing there?

1654
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,095
Hey, careful with my
tail, it was just attached!

1655
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,333
You...

1656
01:36:38,072 --> 01:36:41,000
Hey, get your foot out of my face!

1657
01:36:41,597 --> 01:36:44,000
And out of my nose, please.

1658
01:36:44,304 --> 01:36:45,888
That's not me!

1659
01:36:45,913 --> 01:36:48,101
Oh, Sina, it was your nose?

1660
01:36:48,206 --> 01:36:50,000
I thought it was your mouth, never mind.

1661
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Yeah, how did you guess?

1662
01:36:52,874 --> 01:36:53,826
Let me get back up here...

1663
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:55,113
This is so tight!

1664
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:57,000
That's what she says.

1665
01:37:00,738 --> 01:37:01,738
Damn.

1666
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,199
Are you guys coming?

1667
01:37:08,224 --> 01:37:09,182
We're stuck!

1668
01:37:09,207 --> 01:37:10,000
What?

1669
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Yeah, we're stuck.

1670
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Move it, Lyra!

1671
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:13,381
We can't move.

1672
01:37:14,761 --> 01:37:15,761
Shit.

1673
01:37:16,325 --> 01:37:17,966
Come on, I'll help you.

1674
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,920
Alright

1675
01:37:26,227 --> 01:37:29,346
Dr. Georgette Clooney, at your service.

1676
01:37:29,436 --> 01:37:31,977
Oh, Dr. Clooney.

1677
01:37:33,349 --> 01:37:36,869
You look so competent it
makes my appendix tingle.

1678
01:37:38,111 --> 01:37:41,600
Oh, consider yourself lucky
there wasn't a skeleton there.

1679
01:37:42,436 --> 01:37:44,436
Get your act together, guys.

1680
01:37:45,161 --> 01:37:46,402
Alright, alright.

1681
01:37:46,767 --> 01:37:48,954
This is just too much fun right now.

1682
01:37:49,064 --> 01:37:50,663
Okay, next.

1683
01:37:50,688 --> 01:37:54,253
We need someone to call
Dr. Clooney over the PA

1684
01:37:54,278 --> 01:37:57,278
So the nurse has heard
my name before we come in.

1685
01:38:00,365 --> 01:38:01,365
Link?

1686
01:38:02,064 --> 01:38:03,390
Oh, hey, Sina.

1687
01:38:03,594 --> 01:38:04,279
Are you done yet?

1688
01:38:04,304 --> 01:38:05,304
We need some help!

1689
01:38:07,722 --> 01:38:08,975
And we need some help

1690
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,892
And this sounds like
it's right up your alley.

1691
01:38:12,127 --> 01:38:13,231
Fire away!

1692
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Can you hack into the hospital's PA system

1693
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:22,618
and make an announcement that
Dr. Clooney is urgently needed at the ICU?

1694
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:27,341
Who the fuck is Dr. Clooney?

1695
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,975
That doesn't matter!

1696
01:38:30,222 --> 01:38:31,496
Can you do it or not?

1697
01:38:32,777 --> 01:38:33,975
I don't know...

1698
01:38:34,271 --> 01:38:35,861
Give me a few minutes, will ya?

1699
01:38:35,897 --> 01:38:37,279
Uh-huh, thanks.

1700
01:38:42,586 --> 01:38:43,501
What the?

1701
01:38:43,526 --> 01:38:44,526
Hello?

1702
01:38:44,589 --> 01:38:46,639
Oh, this was way too easy.

1703
01:38:48,518 --> 01:38:50,409
Dr. Clooney, Dr. Clooney

1704
01:38:50,436 --> 01:38:52,714
To the IT security department, please.

1705
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:55,410
Dr. Clooney, we have a breach.

1706
01:38:58,674 --> 01:39:01,077
I don't believe it!

1707
01:39:01,361 --> 01:39:04,433
Can't this man take anything seriously?

1708
01:39:04,687 --> 01:39:08,691
Oh, you'd be surprised with the
things I got away with in the past.

1709
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:11,392
He dropped the name, and that's good enough.

1710
01:39:11,674 --> 01:39:14,397
Now all we need is a patient...

1711
01:39:14,451 --> 01:39:19,089
Oh, and I already know who's
precisely the right man for this!

1712
01:39:25,975 --> 01:39:27,088
Hi, Link.

1713
01:39:27,523 --> 01:39:28,130
Hey, Sina.

1714
01:39:28,155 --> 01:39:29,000
Back so soon?

1715
01:39:29,025 --> 01:39:31,009
Yeah, just come here.

1716
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:31,594
Hey...

1717
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:33,748
I have a little idea...

1718
01:39:34,436 --> 01:39:35,778
Hey, hey, what?

1719
01:39:37,757 --> 01:39:38,757
No!

1720
01:39:40,545 --> 01:39:41,757
So, are you coming?

1721
01:39:41,798 --> 01:39:42,967
We're ready!

1722
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:49,647
Hurry!

1723
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:55,577
Okay, everybody into position.

1724
01:39:55,775 --> 01:40:00,234
Remember, we've been doing this for years,
and we know exactly what we're doing.

1725
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:01,619
On the count of three...

1726
01:40:01,943 --> 01:40:02,731
One

1727
01:40:03,172 --> 01:40:04,015
Two

1728
01:40:04,252 --> 01:40:05,136
Three!

1729
01:40:24,507 --> 01:40:26,000
The pain!

1730
01:40:26,173 --> 01:40:28,768
The pain!

1731
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:32,689
Oh, Dr. Clooney, what are
we supposed to do now?

1732
01:40:32,714 --> 01:40:35,210
I think he has internal
bleeding from the accident!

1733
01:40:35,235 --> 01:40:37,165
Get me the number five G-Tube!

1734
01:40:37,443 --> 01:40:39,137
Now give me some suction!

1735
01:40:39,162 --> 01:40:43,554
Give him 0.3 of WD40 and 0.6 of Kryptonite

1736
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:44,890
and apply the nasal sponge!

1737
01:40:44,915 --> 01:40:47,250
Come on, don't leave us now!

1738
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:51,000
Skin PH 7.73 - slightly wrinkly!

1739
01:40:51,305 --> 01:40:53,000
Heated rectal lavage?

1740
01:40:53,826 --> 01:40:54,531
What?

1741
01:40:54,556 --> 01:40:56,000
Heated rectal lavage?

1742
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
No, his ass won't take it!

1743
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Hey you, I'm Dr. Clooney

1744
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,656
And this is my patient, Mr. Alvio Sengo

1745
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,000
I need a copy of his patient record, stat!

1746
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Hey, what? Doctor who?

1747
01:41:09,085 --> 01:41:12,000
No, Dr. Clooney, now give me that file!

1748
01:41:12,431 --> 01:41:16,000
Oh my god, it's melting!

1749
01:41:16,377 --> 01:41:18,000
What's his temp?

1750
01:41:18,627 --> 01:41:20,174
Temperature...

1751
01:41:24,705 --> 01:41:26,705
Temperature...

1752
01:41:26,896 --> 01:41:28,554
37.5

1753
01:41:28,627 --> 01:41:30,895
It's dribbling down my cheeks

1754
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:32,523
Hurry!

1755
01:41:32,548 --> 01:41:34,557
Oh my god, we are losing him!

1756
01:41:34,582 --> 01:41:35,582
Hurry up!

1757
01:41:35,671 --> 01:41:37,113
All right, all right.

1758
01:41:38,244 --> 01:41:40,164
There's the file

1759
01:41:40,283 --> 01:41:42,426
But this is weird.

1760
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:45,407
Oh, what is weird? Let me see that!

1761
01:41:51,951 --> 01:41:53,033
There we go...

1762
01:41:53,082 --> 01:41:55,454
Let's transfer that to my tablet.

1763
01:41:59,225 --> 01:42:00,824
Guys, I think we're in trouble

1764
01:42:00,849 --> 01:42:02,711
MIB coming at 3 o'clock!

1765
01:42:02,806 --> 01:42:05,252
I'm still connecting, one more second!

1766
01:42:05,277 --> 01:42:06,459
Hurry!

1767
01:42:07,218 --> 01:42:08,507
It's not pairing up!

1768
01:42:08,532 --> 01:42:10,251
Come on, come on, come on...

1769
01:42:10,927 --> 01:42:12,475
Shit, they saw us!

1770
01:42:13,432 --> 01:42:14,470
And done!

1771
01:42:14,536 --> 01:42:16,284
Okay, let's get out of here, quick!

1772
01:42:21,947 --> 01:42:23,288
Into the ambulance, come on!

1773
01:42:23,313 --> 01:42:25,245
Come on, come on!

1774
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:27,270
Oh shit!

1775
01:42:31,583 --> 01:42:33,000
Have you seen this person?

1776
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Why yes, they went that way.

1777
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,826
The ambulance, they're getting away!

1778
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:38,553
Stop them!

1779
01:42:43,328 --> 01:42:46,692
We have located the subject and a
witness who can confirm her identity.

1780
01:42:46,717 --> 01:42:49,110
She's exactly who we think she is.

1781
01:42:49,135 --> 01:42:51,577
We also have the position of her ship in orbit.

1782
01:42:51,602 --> 01:42:54,559
Time to bring the baby home!

1783
01:43:05,166 --> 01:43:07,095
I love you guys!

1784
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:09,658
I've never felt so young in years!

1785
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,120
The way you shook
off those guys in traffic.

1786
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:13,742
Brilliant!

1787
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:18,045
Yeah, the moment I ran the red lights,

1788
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:21,460
sirens blaring, and then
made that sudden left turn,

1789
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:25,860
right in front of the oncoming
truck and into the one-way street!

1790
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:29,100
It was like Star Wars, but with cars.

1791
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,920
You know, Car Wars!

1792
01:43:33,471 --> 01:43:35,620
I wish someone had filmed that.

1793
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,329
I'm sure you're on at least

1794
01:43:38,354 --> 01:43:41,140
1325 traffic cameras.

1795
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:44,010
Let me just check if I
can hack the server.

1796
01:43:47,693 --> 01:43:49,380
Yeah, what a great chase.

1797
01:43:49,449 --> 01:43:52,440
There's nothing more exciting
than expecting to die at any moment.

1798
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,540
Four out of five stars.

1799
01:43:56,542 --> 01:43:57,647
Why only four?

1800
01:43:57,869 --> 01:43:59,120
Because I survived.

1801
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:02,360
Now I have to live with these
memories for the rest of my life.

1802
01:44:04,706 --> 01:44:06,920
Was it at least worth it?

1803
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:12,404
I was so sure Albio's record
would lead us to something.

1804
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,401
But it's all really weird.

1805
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:19,442
He was checked in in the evening
with some kind of neurological disorder.

1806
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:22,641
All kinds of tests were
scheduled for the next day,

1807
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:25,060
but he was declared missing the same night.

1808
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:27,520
No signs of third-party interference.

1809
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,580
Looks like he just got up,

1810
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:32,098
walked out, and was never heard of again.

1811
01:44:33,215 --> 01:44:34,051
So,

1812
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:36,672
seems like our little search is over.

1813
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:39,930
Time to get off this shitty planet.

1814
01:44:40,392 --> 01:44:41,880
You're already giving up?

1815
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:44,912
After all what we've been through?

1816
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:48,400
I thought that we're
just getting warmed up.

1817
01:44:51,177 --> 01:44:55,520
Every minute we stay here gives
our enemies more time to find us.

1818
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:57,460
Whoever that might be.

1819
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,641
What I don't understand,

1820
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,374
I thought Albio was
forced to leave Davida

1821
01:45:02,398 --> 01:45:04,800
right after your family
coerced you back to Earth.

1822
01:45:05,709 --> 01:45:07,660
But no matter how I look at it,

1823
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:10,420
I can't find any evidence for that.

1824
01:45:11,991 --> 01:45:13,140
Of course you don't.

1825
01:45:13,888 --> 01:45:16,560
They know exactly how to play this game.

1826
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,540
What if he simply got cold feet once he
realized what he'd gotten himself into?

1827
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,120
What did you just say?

1828
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,440
Take that back or I will...

1829
01:45:28,661 --> 01:45:30,740
What? Smash in my teeth?

1830
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:34,280
Well, good luck lady,
they're all stainless steel.

1831
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:36,660
I am fed up with this shit.

1832
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:40,560
This whole thing was
nothing but an elaborate trick.

1833
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:44,800
I've been researching
Albio's whereabouts for years.

1834
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:48,565
And then bam! Suddenly
some documents appear

1835
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,420
and lure us right here to Earth.

1836
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,840
That's a bit far-fetched, don't you think?

1837
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:58,660
There are not too many people
in this universe with access to a

1838
01:45:59,156 --> 01:46:01,466
bomb of that size.

1839
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:05,580
And among those are only two
people who know about Albio.

1840
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,560
John and Meredith Stillwater.

1841
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:11,720
That is not something parents do,

1842
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:13,380
not even foster parents.

1843
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,378
You're paranoid.

1844
01:46:16,279 --> 01:46:19,940
I am not going to listen to
you dribble any longer, old man.

1845
01:46:20,444 --> 01:46:22,120
Sorin, let's go.

1846
01:46:22,567 --> 01:46:25,018
And let all this be for nothing?

1847
01:46:26,457 --> 01:46:27,742
Oh no.

1848
01:46:28,793 --> 01:46:32,795
You think I would be stupid
enough to make this hell of

1849
01:46:32,819 --> 01:46:36,820
a trip for nothing but the
unlikely chance to find Albio?

1850
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,500
Then what else did you do it for?

1851
01:46:40,803 --> 01:46:42,056
Guess what?

1852
01:46:43,203 --> 01:46:46,929
I brought Earth a little present.

1853
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,020
What?

1854
01:46:50,005 --> 01:46:52,940
Sina, are you out of your mind?

1855
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,780
That's insane!

1856
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:57,351
Well,

1857
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,284
did you believe I
would just sit on top of

1858
01:47:00,308 --> 01:47:03,760
the bomb and wait until
the UN comes knocking?

1859
01:47:04,608 --> 01:47:09,636
We're gonna blow it right
up in their face in low orbit.

1860
01:47:10,492 --> 01:47:13,480
Over Stillwater Dynamics headquarters.

1861
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:14,681
Nah.

1862
01:47:15,157 --> 01:47:15,897
US...

1863
01:47:16,394 --> 01:47:20,880
the UN military will recognize
what kind of bomb this was.

1864
01:47:21,949 --> 01:47:26,076
That will give the
Stillwaters a lot of explaining

1865
01:47:26,101 --> 01:47:29,241
to do and hit them
where it hurts the most.

1866
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:36,729
The EMP will wipe out electronics
in a radius of hundreds of kilometers.

1867
01:47:37,593 --> 01:47:40,753
Sina, you must be kidding me.

1868
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,160
I'm afraid she's not.

1869
01:47:43,020 --> 01:47:44,000
I just checked.

1870
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:47,043
The remaining container isn't pudding.

1871
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:50,966
She knew we wouldn't have time for
a full inventory check before departure,

1872
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,840
so she swapped the cargo
tags while we weren't looking.

1873
01:47:55,391 --> 01:47:56,041
Sina,

1874
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,593
you lied to me! You abused me!

1875
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,143
Oh, really?

1876
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:06,857
But didn't you dig up the story to
get back to Earth in the first place?

1877
01:48:07,397 --> 01:48:10,280
And here you are!

1878
01:48:10,526 --> 01:48:13,020
You've got exactly what you were promised.

1879
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:17,859
Plus a new identity and a
sizable amount of starting capital.

1880
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:22,420
You owe me a fucking
space station, you know that?

1881
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:25,360
Blowing it up was your own free decision.

1882
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:27,500
I even saved your life.

1883
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:32,480
Which wouldn't have been in danger if these
mercs hadn't been after your bloody ship,

1884
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,900
goddammit!

1885
01:48:33,965 --> 01:48:34,915
Sina,

1886
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:38,321
you're drunk and you're angry.

1887
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:42,102
I'm not letting you bomb
the planet in such a condition.

1888
01:48:43,498 --> 01:48:45,492
Then I will do it myself.

1889
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:47,273
You're fired.

1890
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:49,220
It's my ship now.

1891
01:48:49,965 --> 01:48:51,825
And I'm still the commander.

1892
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:55,807
I will let you know where you can
pick it up when I don't need it anymore.

1893
01:48:57,303 --> 01:48:58,023
no, Sina!

1894
01:48:59,376 --> 01:49:02,020
Sina, come back! Sit back down,

1895
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,660
you're making a terrible mistake!

1896
01:49:04,772 --> 01:49:05,495
Let me go!

1897
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:06,715
you motherfucker...

1898
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:08,440
Son of a bitch!

1899
01:49:10,407 --> 01:49:15,083
Hey, you! Ice Queen!
That's enough! Come on!

1900
01:49:15,674 --> 01:49:16,695
You come here!

1901
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,145
Come on! Hey!

1902
01:49:19,987 --> 01:49:21,320
Ice Queen comes with us!

1903
01:49:22,043 --> 01:49:23,183
Come on!

1904
01:49:24,214 --> 01:49:26,114
You can cool off outside!

1905
01:49:27,437 --> 01:49:30,547
And I don't want to see
your face ever again!

1906
01:49:35,527 --> 01:49:37,250
What the hell just happened?

1907
01:49:37,275 --> 01:49:39,091
I don't know.

1908
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:40,313
Well,

1909
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,000
looks like the Snow Queen flipped the lid.

1910
01:49:44,771 --> 01:49:45,421
Well,

1911
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:50,252
with a little luck she's so drunk she
won't even make it to the spaceport.

1912
01:49:51,235 --> 01:49:53,255
She just called a shuttle.

1913
01:49:54,704 --> 01:49:55,263
Damn.

1914
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:57,400
So how are we going to stop her now?

1915
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,940
Do you think it's really
the UN who's after her?

1916
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:02,560
Or her parents?

1917
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:04,833
My best bet is on ERG.

1918
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:06,951
They have a motive to blow up Juno.

1919
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,085
They have the power to pull it off.

1920
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:12,021
And they have a good
reason to be after Sina.

1921
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,780
They could have tracked us through Ten's
tablet that was still logged into CommNet.

1922
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:19,961
Also,

1923
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,640
I have met the Stillwaters.

1924
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,900
It's been a couple of years,

1925
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,107
but they were surprisingly down to
earth for being as influential as they are.

1926
01:50:29,613 --> 01:50:30,386
Agreed.

1927
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,635
From what we know,

1928
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:33,228
they actually cared a lot about her.

1929
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:36,774
Even when she got herself
pregnant without a permit.

1930
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:41,235
I'm pretty sure they paramountly wanted
to keep her from doing anything stupid.

1931
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:43,428
And if she reacted back
then when confronted

1932
01:50:43,452 --> 01:50:45,743
with her own mistakes
like she does today,

1933
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,420
that would explain a lot.

1934
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:49,331
Say,

1935
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:53,357
when was the last time she
actually talked to her parents?

1936
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:54,579
Well, I don't know.

1937
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:56,992
A long time ago, I suspect.

1938
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,888
I don't remember her
talking about them at all.

1939
01:51:04,182 --> 01:51:05,622
She's on the shuttle now.

1940
01:51:06,981 --> 01:51:08,768
Can you lock her out of the ship?

1941
01:51:08,935 --> 01:51:09,880
Not from here.

1942
01:51:10,796 --> 01:51:13,511
Let's say goodbye to
the world as we know it.

1943
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:17,116
Deploying a bomb by hand from
a container inside a cargo hold

1944
01:51:17,141 --> 01:51:19,660
of a freighter is not exactly
standard procedure, you know.

1945
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:23,074
At least, I don't
think she'll be able to

1946
01:51:23,098 --> 01:51:25,560
pull it off while being
shit-faced like that.

1947
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,940
So, we might still have some time.

1948
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,192
Should we call the UN then?

1949
01:51:31,265 --> 01:51:34,730
That would literally be
the end of the Pioneers.

1950
01:51:36,797 --> 01:51:38,180
If you want to save the world,

1951
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:41,174
we have to first save Sina from herself.

1952
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:42,365
Huh?

1953
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:43,795
What do you mean?

1954
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:47,144
She's acting like a little girl who
thinks there is a monster living

1955
01:51:47,169 --> 01:51:51,187
under her bed and that she can
get rid of it by throwing a bomb on it.

1956
01:51:51,820 --> 01:51:52,657
A monster?

1957
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:55,580
That's her past catching up on her, right?

1958
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:56,780
Precisely.

1959
01:51:57,496 --> 01:52:00,340
And there is only one way
to destroy that monster.

1960
01:52:00,971 --> 01:52:02,963
That sounds like you have a plan.

1961
01:52:03,529 --> 01:52:05,140
I thought you'd never ask.

1962
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:06,927
Let's get dressed.

1963
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:10,082
We're going to meet some
important people tonight.

1964
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,765
Do you guys know how to play golf?

1965
01:52:20,052 --> 01:52:21,417
Public key accepted.

1966
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,022
Two-factor authentication required.

1967
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:25,720
Please supply the passphrase.

1968
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:30,095
How much wood would a woodchuck
chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1969
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:33,087
Thank you for calling
Dynamo Trading Limited.

1970
01:52:33,248 --> 01:52:34,468
Please hold the line.

1971
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,748
One day I'm going to string
him for this passphrase.

1972
01:52:38,773 --> 01:52:40,135
Oh, hi Brian.

1973
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:40,812
What's up?

1974
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:42,060
Finally you're picking up.

1975
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,372
I've been trying to reach you for hours!

1976
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,604
Don't forget to keep your back straight.

1977
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:47,415
Now,

1978
01:52:47,464 --> 01:52:48,141
swing.

1979
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:54,980
And the next thing we're
going to work on is your aim.

1980
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,100
Hang on, Brian's still on the phone.

1981
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:58,085
BRIAN!

1982
01:52:58,332 --> 01:52:59,602
Link, seriously?

1983
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,388
Every fucking two or three
letter agency in the solar system

1984
01:53:02,412 --> 01:53:05,147
is trying to get us and you're
playing golf with your friends?

1985
01:53:05,245 --> 01:53:06,176
Correction.

1986
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:08,722
I'm playing golf with my
friends and some very,

1987
01:53:08,747 --> 01:53:10,014
very important people.

1988
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:12,360
That's nice, but you do
realize that the BI has just

1989
01:53:12,384 --> 01:53:14,600
put out a wanted poster
with your picture on it?

1990
01:53:14,936 --> 01:53:15,409
Oh,

1991
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:18,511
are they still using that
one from my old passport?

1992
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,355
The one with the silly hair?

1993
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:22,891
No, this time they're
using a more recent one.

1994
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:26,400
And it seems like you have a
giant ice cream cone up your butt?

1995
01:53:27,748 --> 01:53:30,180
Oh, can you please get
me a copy of that one?

1996
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,930
I am totally going to frame that.

1997
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,389
But how did they find out it's me?

1998
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:38,389
I should be invisible to
their face recognition system.

1999
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:42,585
Well, you know, most living beings have
some pretty good face recognition built in.

2000
01:53:42,712 --> 01:53:44,240
Someone recognized me?

2001
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:45,476
Who?

2002
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:46,659
No idea,

2003
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:50,586
but they updated your biometric profile
and they know precisely where you are.

2004
01:53:50,991 --> 01:53:53,483
Unless you manage to
file and pay 15 years worth

2005
01:53:53,508 --> 01:53:55,755
of outstanding taxes
within the next five minutes,

2006
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:57,120
you better get out of there.

2007
01:53:57,764 --> 01:53:58,885
You have a point.

2008
01:53:59,020 --> 01:54:00,960
Is there a way we can stall these guys?

2009
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:02,440
I am not quite done here.

2010
01:54:02,725 --> 01:54:03,345
No?

2011
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:08,040
Is it just the cameras or do they
have any other way to track me?

2012
01:54:08,335 --> 01:54:09,482
I have no idea.

2013
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,647
I bet it's just the cameras.

2014
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:15,339
Link, you gotta run! Or rather drive! Now!

2015
01:54:15,427 --> 01:54:16,780
I know I'm taking a risk,

2016
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:18,940
but these people are worth it.

2017
01:54:19,104 --> 01:54:19,884
Trust me.

2018
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:22,720
And besides, I'm also
trying to save the world here.

2019
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:24,080
You've got some nerve!

2020
01:54:24,348 --> 01:54:25,835
I don't need much time.

2021
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:26,820
Maybe an hour.

2022
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:29,000
The camera system is extremely stupid.

2023
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:31,471
You can fool it with a simple paper bag.

2024
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:34,900
Yeah, I'm sure a crazy old guy
on a golf cart wearing a paper bag

2025
01:54:34,925 --> 01:54:38,088
over his face is not going to
raise any suspicion whatsoever.

2026
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,410
Not if you create enough of a distraction.

2027
01:54:40,648 --> 01:54:42,004
Take the reward poster,

2028
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:43,627
put it on all the message boards,

2029
01:54:43,758 --> 01:54:46,900
and offer 5,000 Super Coins to anyone to print it out,

2030
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:48,340
glue it to the nearest wall,

2031
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:49,678
and take a selfie.

2032
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:52,173
That will create a lot of false positives,

2033
01:54:52,292 --> 01:54:55,534
and the time it will take them to
realize what's happening and to

2034
01:54:55,558 --> 01:54:58,971
filter that out should be just
enough for me to finish the job.

2035
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:00,323
5,000?

2036
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:02,305
That's gonna cost you a fortune!

2037
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:04,480
As I said, it will be worth it.

2038
01:55:04,820 --> 01:55:05,240
Do it.

2039
01:55:05,683 --> 01:55:06,152
Now.

2040
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:08,620
And I need you to organize a pickup for me.

2041
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:11,567
I gotta get off this planet
and lay low for a while.

2042
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:12,840
That's what you said last week,

2043
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,223
and we all know where that went.

2044
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,841
No guts, no glory.

2045
01:55:16,088 --> 01:55:16,701
Link out!

2046
01:55:17,427 --> 01:55:19,867
I hate my life.

2047
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:40,203
That was close.

2048
01:55:48,304 --> 01:55:50,220
Oh Fuck!

2049
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:59,405
Ahh, I can't get this!

2050
01:56:02,648 --> 01:56:04,228
Ah, screw it.

2051
01:56:14,392 --> 01:56:15,432
yes, yes.

2052
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:17,360
For Juno's sake.

2053
01:56:19,098 --> 01:56:20,450
Good morning, Sina.

2054
01:56:20,780 --> 01:56:24,280
Oh, goodness, you look terrible.

2055
01:56:24,820 --> 01:56:25,392
Yeah,

2056
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:27,540
I'm hungover like a rocket.

2057
01:56:28,660 --> 01:56:29,400
What's up?

2058
01:56:30,698 --> 01:56:33,060
I kinda don't want to stay behind on Earth,

2059
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:34,600
so will you let me dock?

2060
01:56:36,151 --> 01:56:36,901
Sure.

2061
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:38,637
It's your ship, after all.

2062
01:56:39,246 --> 01:56:40,165
Where are you?

2063
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:42,175
Here's my ID and vector.

2064
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:43,750
I'll be there in a minute.

2065
01:56:45,341 --> 01:56:46,401
There you go.

2066
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,220
Computer should guide you in.

2067
01:56:48,700 --> 01:56:49,275
Perfect.

2068
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:50,135
See you in a bit.

2069
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:50,887
Sorin out.

2070
01:57:14,977 --> 01:57:16,735
Shuttle docked to main chute.

2071
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:17,780
Please confirm.

2072
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:19,273
Yeah,

2073
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:20,440
let them in.

2074
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,038
Affirmative.

2075
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:33,980
Lyra!

2076
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,500
What are you doing here?

2077
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,960
Didn't you want to stay on Earth?

2078
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:42,139
-I was worried about you!
-Yeah, we all were.

2079
01:57:42,920 --> 01:57:44,340
We came to help you.

2080
01:57:45,144 --> 01:57:47,951
Then I hope you brought
some hangover medication,

2081
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:51,618
because this goddamn space
truck doesn't seem to have any.

2082
01:57:51,727 --> 01:57:54,050
Do you remember what you did last night?

2083
01:57:55,883 --> 01:57:56,533
Look,

2084
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:59,320
if you came back to
lecture me about morals,

2085
01:57:59,456 --> 01:58:01,888
world peace and everything
I've done wrong in my life,

2086
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:04,006
you can fuck right off.

2087
01:58:05,483 --> 01:58:07,813
You're about to bomb the planet, Sina.

2088
01:58:08,296 --> 01:58:12,011
Have you considered the possibility
that things are not always what they seem?

2089
01:58:14,972 --> 01:58:15,875
And why?

2090
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,337
Do you think I'm crazy?

2091
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,035
No,

2092
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,833
I think you're in pain.

2093
01:58:20,829 --> 01:58:22,525
And I don't mean the hangover.

2094
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:25,215
You act like a cornered animal.

2095
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:28,079
No rational thoughts
and just fight or flight.

2096
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:30,172
That's none of your business.

2097
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:33,840
You're about to make this the
business of 10 billion people!

2098
01:58:33,865 --> 01:58:35,009
Lyra, Lyra,

2099
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:36,130
stop it, please.

2100
01:58:38,172 --> 01:58:38,972
So,

2101
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:39,834
yeah,

2102
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:41,507
there you have it.

2103
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,042
I'm hurting.

2104
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:46,020
I've been hurting for years.

2105
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:47,740
And the closer I get to

2106
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,200
this goddamn blue planet,

2107
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:50,440
the worse it got.

2108
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:55,600
But I'm going to make
it stop once and for all.

2109
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,840
If you can't live with that,

2110
01:58:58,100 --> 01:59:00,064
you better take a different ship home.

2111
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:01,340
But there is another way.

2112
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:03,919
While you were sleeping,

2113
01:59:04,829 --> 01:59:07,869
while you were sleeping
off your little romp,

2114
01:59:08,088 --> 01:59:12,064
Link helped me meet up with a few
very interesting people back on Earth.

2115
01:59:12,663 --> 01:59:13,683
We talked a lot and

2116
01:59:13,767 --> 01:59:16,143
I learned a lot about you.

2117
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:19,240
I understand your pain now and your hate.

2118
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:20,880
And I know what needs

2119
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:25,313
to be done to heal it without
plunging Earth into war.

2120
01:59:25,684 --> 01:59:26,629
About me?

2121
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:28,660
Who on Earth would...

2122
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:30,260
Oh no.

2123
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,460
You didn't.

2124
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,780
Tell me you didn't.

2125
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:35,860
Sina, calm down.

2126
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:37,040
Everything is all right.

2127
01:59:37,707 --> 01:59:38,550
Computer,

2128
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:41,287
how many passengers
are on board of the shuttle?

2129
01:59:41,481 --> 01:59:44,099
There are two passengers
on board of the shuttle.

2130
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:45,138
Computer,

2131
01:59:45,163 --> 01:59:47,094
close the airlock immediately.

2132
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:48,355
Complying.

2133
01:59:48,380 --> 01:59:50,427
Correction, unable to comply.

2134
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:52,088
Door mechanism blocked.

2135
01:59:54,435 --> 01:59:55,784
How dare you?

2136
01:59:56,255 --> 01:59:57,675
How dare you?

2137
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:00,094
They just want to talk, okay?

2138
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:03,300
They really...

2139
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:04,440
There is nothing to it.

2140
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:05,640
They just want to talk.

2141
02:00:09,319 --> 02:00:13,047
You motherfucking son
of a bitch betrayed me!

2142
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,240
No, no, no, Sina, stop it!

2143
02:00:15,265 --> 02:00:16,265
Soren!

2144
02:00:21,164 --> 02:00:24,420
Stay back or I will...

2145
02:00:25,387 --> 02:00:27,007
Sina!

2146
02:00:29,555 --> 02:00:32,395
What the hell are you doing here?

2147
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,670
It's so good to see you.

2148
02:00:35,591 --> 02:00:37,658
We thought we'd never see you again.

2149
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:41,720
You have ten seconds to get off my ship.

2150
02:00:44,038 --> 02:00:45,078
Ten?

2151
02:00:45,909 --> 02:00:48,597
You're going to shoot an
unarmed, defenseless man?

2152
02:00:49,067 --> 02:00:50,257
What happened to you?

2153
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,847
The daughter I knew
would never have done that.

2154
02:00:53,871 --> 02:00:54,549
Ten

2155
02:00:55,251 --> 02:00:56,291
Nine

2156
02:00:56,910 --> 02:00:57,630
Eight

2157
02:00:58,667 --> 02:00:59,827
Seven

2158
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:03,426
How is life on Juno Station?

2159
02:01:04,141 --> 02:01:05,861
Are you happy out there?

2160
02:01:06,212 --> 02:01:07,194
Six

2161
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:09,053
Five

2162
02:01:09,845 --> 02:01:10,668
Four

2163
02:01:10,696 --> 02:01:13,533
I brought you some cake.

2164
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:15,720
It even has real strawberries in it.

2165
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:18,023
You always loved strawberries.

2166
02:01:19,844 --> 02:01:20,715
Three

2167
02:01:21,676 --> 02:01:23,136
Two

2168
02:01:23,939 --> 02:01:25,179
One

2169
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,510
Here.

2170
02:01:30,271 --> 02:01:30,975
Please,

2171
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:31,682
take it.

2172
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:32,640
It's for you.

2173
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:41,463
Why are you doing this to me?

2174
02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:45,155
Why are you here?

2175
02:01:45,180 --> 02:01:46,350
Why?

2176
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:51,949
We've sent you so many
messages over the last ten years,

2177
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:54,247
and you haven't answered a single one.

2178
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:56,678
What have we done to deserve this?

2179
02:01:58,065 --> 02:01:58,960
You...

2180
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:00,394
What have...

2181
02:02:00,419 --> 02:02:03,575
You know exactly and
perfectly what you did!

2182
02:02:03,765 --> 02:02:05,079
No, I don't.

2183
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:06,320
Bullshit!

2184
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,154
Sina,

2185
02:02:08,836 --> 02:02:10,376
can we sit down and talk?

2186
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,366
Please,

2187
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:12,937
just for a moment.

2188
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:13,619
Okay,

2189
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:14,730
fine.

2190
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:18,006
If that means you'll leave
me alone afterwards.

2191
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:19,450
So be it.

2192
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:26,856
Now,

2193
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:27,745
Sina,

2194
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:31,366
please tell us why you're so mad at us.

2195
02:02:33,515 --> 02:02:34,335
Well,

2196
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:35,480
who knows?

2197
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:40,414
Maybe because you
took away my unborn child.

2198
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:45,194
Or maybe because you took
away the man that I loved.

2199
02:02:45,491 --> 02:02:47,951
Or, let me think,

2200
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:53,094
maybe because you sent a
motherfucking bomb to me.

2201
02:02:53,496 --> 02:02:56,455
Is that really what you believe we did?

2202
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:58,220
But why would we do that?

2203
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:04,560
Because I no longer fit your perfect little
ideal of your perfect little poster child.

2204
02:03:05,186 --> 02:03:08,623
The daughter of leaders of
the military-industrial complex,

2205
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:13,488
running off with a dirty commoner
during the steepest part of her career.

2206
02:03:14,516 --> 02:03:16,742
I only ever had one perfect ideal,

2207
02:03:16,829 --> 02:03:18,637
And that was making you happy!

2208
02:03:19,285 --> 02:03:21,785
Going to space was
always your biggest dream.

2209
02:03:22,211 --> 02:03:24,043
I made sure you got the best education,

2210
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:25,979
so I helped you to enroll with the UN.

2211
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:28,929
Not because I wanted my own pet soldier.

2212
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:31,917
I did it to help you to
make that dream come true,

2213
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:34,298
so you can be happy.

2214
02:03:34,766 --> 02:03:36,691
I always thought that was obvious,

2215
02:03:37,031 --> 02:03:39,191
but apparently it wasn't.

2216
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:40,844
And for that,

2217
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:44,656
I truly blame myself every
single day since you were gone.

2218
02:03:47,707 --> 02:03:50,437
You are not mad at me
for leaving the military?

2219
02:03:50,516 --> 02:03:51,559
Oh no.

2220
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:54,385
Well, maybe we were for a while,

2221
02:03:54,897 --> 02:03:57,776
but we learned to accept that
you had to go your own way.

2222
02:03:57,940 --> 02:04:00,139
And look what you achieved!

2223
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:02,600
We are so proud of you.

2224
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:05,804
You can't imagine how many
sleepless nights we spent

2225
02:04:05,828 --> 02:04:08,080
trying to find ways to
keep you safe out there.

2226
02:04:08,930 --> 02:04:10,720
You're making this up.

2227
02:04:11,903 --> 02:04:14,120
The UN has been under
immense pressure by the extra

2228
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:17,675
planetary resource group to
finally strike out at the pioneers.

2229
02:04:18,141 --> 02:04:19,800
We used all the power we have.

2230
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:23,195
We spent millions in campaigning
money to keep that from happening.

2231
02:04:24,554 --> 02:04:27,434
And now you're here to collect your reward?

2232
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:30,213
No, you are our daughter.

2233
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,595
We love you.

2234
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:33,380
We want nothing in return.

2235
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:35,792
Not even your bomb?

2236
02:04:36,295 --> 02:04:37,475
Not even that.

2237
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,500
And it is not our bomb?

2238
02:04:39,556 --> 02:04:40,928
Of course it is!

2239
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:42,360
It has your name on it!

2240
02:04:43,558 --> 02:04:46,058
That is a whole different story.

2241
02:04:47,421 --> 02:04:49,237
I'm not saying we didn't mess up,

2242
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,887
because we did in many ways.

2243
02:04:54,555 --> 02:04:59,315
I got into the weapons business because
I believed in the ideal of a united earth,

2244
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:01,557
led by a democratic government,

2245
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:03,050
able to put up a fight.

2246
02:05:03,447 --> 02:05:06,422
Seeing the fight turning
against you was one

2247
02:05:06,446 --> 02:05:09,544
of the most horrifying
experiences of my life.

2248
02:05:09,933 --> 02:05:12,697
And never have I felt so much regret.

2249
02:05:13,973 --> 02:05:15,783
But we did not send the bomb.

2250
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,826
Neither did the UN military.

2251
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:19,115
I swear.

2252
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:20,519
Then who did it?

2253
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:23,147
Lyra gave us access to her research.

2254
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,225
And everything points to ERG.

2255
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:27,027
They have the resources,

2256
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:29,818
the power and certainly a motive.

2257
02:05:30,251 --> 02:05:32,254
The device was definitely stolen.

2258
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:33,984
If you would hand it to us,

2259
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:39,242
we could look for evidence and bring the
conspirators to court where they belong.

2260
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:42,585
It would be your responsibility
to decide that, of course.

2261
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:45,530
If that bomb explodes
anywhere near planet Earth,

2262
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:48,186
it would be seen as the
most sincere act of terrorism.

2263
02:05:49,044 --> 02:05:49,732
You know,

2264
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:52,530
technically the pioneers are
still an illegal organization.

2265
02:05:52,890 --> 02:05:56,758
But a large part of earth's population
secretly admires you, your spirit.

2266
02:05:57,340 --> 02:05:59,437
That would change overnight.

2267
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:02,332
And our limited power
to hold our shielding paws

2268
02:06:02,357 --> 02:06:05,860
over Juno Station would
be literally blown away.

2269
02:06:06,413 --> 02:06:10,329
And always remember that
whoever is going to be affected

2270
02:06:10,369 --> 02:06:14,992
also has a mother and a father and
possibly a son or a daughter.

2271
02:06:15,066 --> 02:06:18,803
That's a pretty late realization
for a weapons dealer, isn't it?

2272
02:06:19,562 --> 02:06:20,374
Yes.

2273
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,605
Too late, I know.

2274
02:06:23,954 --> 02:06:26,634
Then I have one last question.

2275
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:28,960
What happened to Albio?

2276
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,270
I seriously don't know.

2277
02:06:31,295 --> 02:06:33,088
Be honest with me!

2278
02:06:33,501 --> 02:06:35,822
When you told us about your pregnancy,

2279
02:06:36,056 --> 02:06:38,310
I had a long private conversation with him.

2280
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:41,247
I asked him if he was
aware of what he just did.

2281
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:46,610
That both of you would have to face severe
consequences if you carried out that child.

2282
02:06:46,844 --> 02:06:50,021
And if he was ready to give
up his current life for you,

2283
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,716
lose his job, face the fines.

2284
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:56,545
I tried to appeal to his
reason and his conscience.

2285
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:00,052
It seemed like he hadn't spent
a single thought on the future.

2286
02:07:00,556 --> 02:07:02,896
He eventually panicked and hung up on me.

2287
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,520
That is the last time I
ever heard from him.

2288
02:07:06,064 --> 02:07:07,193
No way!

2289
02:07:08,153 --> 02:07:11,153
It looks like he took what
he still had and ran away.

2290
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:13,360
And if he hadn't abandoned you that day,

2291
02:07:13,961 --> 02:07:15,941
he would have done so later.

2292
02:07:17,075 --> 02:07:18,968
If that's really the truth,

2293
02:07:18,993 --> 02:07:21,164
then why did you never tell me?

2294
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,535
Why?

2295
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:26,075
I tried literally hundreds of times,

2296
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:27,881
but you wouldn't listen.

2297
02:07:35,568 --> 02:07:39,529
I'm such a ruthless piece of shit.

2298
02:07:41,513 --> 02:07:42,395
No,

2299
02:07:43,063 --> 02:07:44,595
you are not.

2300
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:47,492
And this is not my proudest day either.

2301
02:07:47,730 --> 02:07:49,963
But we are still family.

2302
02:07:50,348 --> 02:07:52,689
Together we can pull through this.

2303
02:07:53,468 --> 02:07:55,668
I really wish we could.

2304
02:07:56,339 --> 02:07:58,675
I don't see why we couldn't.

2305
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:00,618
You don't understand.

2306
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:02,898
Understand what?

2307
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:07,515
We can't go back.

2308
02:08:08,542 --> 02:08:10,882
The bomb is already in orbit.

2309
02:08:18,177 --> 02:08:19,809
Are you kidding me?

2310
02:08:19,834 --> 02:08:21,763
Kamari, if you don't calm down,

2311
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,297
I'm going to call security.

2312
02:08:23,377 --> 02:08:25,092
Almost a month of research,

2313
02:08:25,117 --> 02:08:27,725
interviews, inquiries, filming, editing,

2314
02:08:27,780 --> 02:08:28,620
all for what?

2315
02:08:28,868 --> 02:08:29,750
Nothing?

2316
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:32,157
But Kamari, that's part of our job.

2317
02:08:32,260 --> 02:08:34,500
This isn't just some filler material.

2318
02:08:34,676 --> 02:08:37,229
This is stuff people have
a right to know about.

2319
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:39,898
I know that you put a lot
of work into your report.

2320
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:42,027
And rejecting it wasn't easy.

2321
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:44,827
But we discussed it with the
National Broadcasting Council.

2322
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:46,300
And we came to the conclusion that

2323
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:49,525
it would be irresponsible to
show a report like that right now.

2324
02:08:49,604 --> 02:08:51,768
It's irresponsible not to show it.

2325
02:08:51,832 --> 02:08:55,584
Right now we have violent protests
in front of ERG's headquarters.

2326
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,352
Half of the African
continent is still rejecting the

2327
02:08:58,377 --> 02:09:01,158
UN World Government and
they are arming themselves up.

2328
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:05,012
The Socialist Party is calling for
an impeachment of the president.

2329
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:08,486
The BI and the Federal Police
have just suspended a quarter

2330
02:09:08,510 --> 02:09:11,578
of their executive staff
for allegations of bribery.

2331
02:09:11,765 --> 02:09:14,578
And you say throwing a
bomb like that into an already

2332
02:09:14,602 --> 02:09:17,796
unstable situation would be
the responsible thing to do?

2333
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:20,715
A free press is the
foundation of democracy.

2334
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,843
We can't hold back the truth just
because it might upset someone.

2335
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:28,631
If you look at the scale of
everything that is happening right now,

2336
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:32,328
people aren't nearly as
upset as they should be.

2337
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:33,775
You got some great points,

2338
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:36,117
but it's all very incomplete
and inconclusive.

2339
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:37,967
Of course it's incomplete.

2340
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:41,563
That's because it's a developing
story that is happening right now.

2341
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:44,834
And so far, we're the only
ones who know about it.

2342
02:09:45,181 --> 02:09:48,463
Wait until the rest of the
world gets their hands on this.

2343
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:50,191
But what if you're wrong?

2344
02:09:50,292 --> 02:09:51,747
Wrong about what?

2345
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:53,668
That something is going on?

2346
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,599
Hell, did you even read the goddamn script?

2347
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:58,102
Within just a few weeks,

2348
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:01,285
an ERG freighter goes
missing in the middle of nowhere,

2349
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:06,272
Link Kabanshee Station gets destroyed
by a nuclear explosion in plain sight,

2350
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:10,968
and some impostors trying to steal
patient records related to Sina Stillwater

2351
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:14,577
get chased through the city
of Stockholm in an ambulance.

2352
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:18,255
And everyone is acting
like it all never happened.

2353
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:22,463
It's almost like someone powerful is
doing all they can to cover something up.

2354
02:10:22,669 --> 02:10:24,542
Weird stuff happens all the time.

2355
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:27,209
These things could be completely unrelated.

2356
02:10:27,648 --> 02:10:30,767
Then you might be interested in
the documents I got this morning.

2357
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:32,455
Here, look at them.

2358
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:32,942
Oh,

2359
02:10:34,416 --> 02:10:35,942
what exactly am I looking at here?

2360
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:38,502
That's the passenger list of the Darwin,

2361
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:40,440
the freighter that disappeared in sector

2362
02:10:40,499 --> 02:10:41,830
4385.

2363
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:43,273
Look at line 31.

2364
02:10:43,940 --> 02:10:44,917
Lyra Senick?

2365
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:46,196
Who is she again?

2366
02:10:46,276 --> 02:10:49,699
She's a good friend of mine and
one of my most reliable sources.

2367
02:10:49,752 --> 02:10:51,749
She was the one who
blew the cover of the

2368
02:10:51,773 --> 02:10:54,512
Bureau of Investigation
being in bed with ERG.

2369
02:10:54,732 --> 02:10:56,811
She should have won a Pulitzer for that,

2370
02:10:56,980 --> 02:10:59,910
but the powers that be
sent her to Vesta instead.

2371
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:02,584
But she never arrived there.

2372
02:11:02,961 --> 02:11:03,893
Swipe left.

2373
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:07,178
Here is the security
camera footage from the

2374
02:11:07,202 --> 02:11:10,092
Karolinska University
Hospital in Stockholm.

2375
02:11:10,256 --> 02:11:12,355
It shows the alleged impostors.

2376
02:11:12,756 --> 02:11:13,562
Stop here.

2377
02:11:13,597 --> 02:11:14,650
Now zoom in.

2378
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:15,940
There.

2379
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:17,724
Who are they?

2380
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:19,140
Lyra Senick,

2381
02:11:19,405 --> 02:11:20,763
Sina Stillwater,

2382
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:22,273
and Link Kabanshee.

2383
02:11:22,388 --> 02:11:23,137
Alive,

2384
02:11:23,162 --> 02:11:26,096
free, and on this very planet.

2385
02:11:26,197 --> 02:11:26,881
Bam!

2386
02:11:26,954 --> 02:11:29,357
Still think the events aren't related?

2387
02:11:29,874 --> 02:11:31,095
That can't be.

2388
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:34,440
Their faces would have been flagged
by every security camera the moment

2389
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:35,793
they set their paws on Earth.

2390
02:11:36,063 --> 02:11:37,335
And yet here they are.

2391
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:38,650
But it gets better.

2392
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:40,196
Swipe left once more.

2393
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,084
And what's that?

2394
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:47,178
A document leaked by a whistleblower about
an internal UN military investigation.

2395
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:49,704
Apparently a bomb went missing.

2396
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:51,472
And not just any bomb.

2397
02:11:51,660 --> 02:11:55,100
A Stillwater Dynamics D-Z/4 antimatter bomb.

2398
02:11:56,086 --> 02:11:58,962
Kamari, do you have
any idea what happens if

2399
02:11:58,987 --> 02:12:01,511
that information gets
into the wrong hands?

2400
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:04,027
What do you mean, the wrong hands?

2401
02:12:04,420 --> 02:12:07,443
I'm going to ask you to seize
your investigation immediately.

2402
02:12:07,609 --> 02:12:10,395
I'm transferring you to the
Department of Regional Affairs.

2403
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:12,954
-The hell you are!
-Regional Affairs, Kamari,

2404
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:14,568
effective immediately.

2405
02:12:14,700 --> 02:12:15,360
Clarence,

2406
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:18,209
this is bullshit! I quit!

2407
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:20,405
That's your choice.

2408
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:24,065
Just don't forget you're still bound by
the non-disclosure agreement you signed.

2409
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:26,844
Unless you want to end
up like your friend Lyra.

2410
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:29,819
Did you just threaten me?

2411
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:31,588
Yes, I absolutely did.

2412
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,695
You'd better be careful who you mess with.

2413
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:36,298
Oh, it was you who
blew Lyra's cover, right?

2414
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:37,673
How dare you!

2415
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:41,335
The protection of our sources
is the key to a free press.

2416
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:42,513
A free press?

2417
02:12:43,251 --> 02:12:44,475
There is no such thing.

2418
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:45,467
Never was.

2419
02:12:45,768 --> 02:12:47,060
And speaking of freedom,

2420
02:12:47,140 --> 02:12:48,403
you're now free to go.

2421
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:51,728
And you'd better do so quickly
before I change my mind.

2422
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,424
Farewell, Ms.
Suarez.

2423
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:56,226
We wish you a lot of success
for your future career path.

2424
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,483
And don't forget,

2425
02:12:57,676 --> 02:12:59,082
we'll be watching you.

2426
02:12:59,436 --> 02:13:01,737
Farewell, Mr. Blankenship.

2427
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:04,840
And fuck you!

2428
02:13:23,270 --> 02:13:23,840
Okay,

2429
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:25,760
we're at a safe distance now.

2430
02:13:26,465 --> 02:13:28,292
You're still sure you
want to do this alone?

2431
02:13:29,527 --> 02:13:30,855
I fucked it up.

2432
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:32,540
I'm going to fix it.

2433
02:13:39,314 --> 02:13:41,378
Approaching the container now.

2434
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,455
Alright, let me know when
it's safe to approach again.

2435
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:47,013
I wasn't planning to set up camp.

2436
02:13:49,546 --> 02:13:51,036
And touchdown.

2437
02:13:51,832 --> 02:13:53,712
I'm going to open the hatch now.

2438
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:04,757
careful out there!

2439
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:05,635
Oh,

2440
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:07,317
yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.

2441
02:14:10,270 --> 02:14:11,965
Everything is under control.

2442
02:14:42,604 --> 02:14:43,501
There we go.

2443
02:14:48,946 --> 02:14:52,876
Hurry up! There's a small vehicle
on the radar and it's approaching fast.

2444
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:55,572
It seems we're not the only
ones looking for this thing.

2445
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:56,940
I'll do my best.

2446
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:09,869
They're getting closer.

2447
02:15:11,996 --> 02:15:14,275
Shit!

2448
02:15:14,300 --> 02:15:15,239
What is it?

2449
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:19,149
It won't scan my paw
through the spacesuit.

2450
02:15:20,343 --> 02:15:21,923
Well, Meredith said it should.

2451
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,780
But it doesn't.

2452
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:26,409
Okay, keep trying.

2453
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,880
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

2454
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:31,122
Why doesn't it work?

2455
02:15:33,426 --> 02:15:35,555
I've got a visual on the other ship now.

2456
02:15:35,580 --> 02:15:37,185
It is a tiny vessel.

2457
02:15:38,034 --> 02:15:40,985
It seems like some sort of mining drone.

2458
02:15:41,953 --> 02:15:44,249
Seems like ERG wants to get their toy back.

2459
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:45,435
Okay, we're coming.

2460
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:45,953
No!

2461
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:47,540
If this thing goes off,

2462
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:49,440
the radiation is going to grill you.

2463
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:50,380
I don't care.

2464
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:51,435
We're coming back.

2465
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:52,158
No!

2466
02:15:52,540 --> 02:15:53,420
Shut up!

2467
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:57,479
You're supposed to keep my
parents out of the goddamn blast zone.

2468
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:00,447
Which part of shut up do
I have to explain to you?

2469
02:16:01,333 --> 02:16:02,439
Your mom and dad are fine.

2470
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:03,960
Both just gave me the thumbs up.

2471
02:16:05,302 --> 02:16:07,397
Can you get rid of that ERG ship?

2472
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:08,460
Not really.

2473
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:09,680
We're in Earth orbit.

2474
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:11,260
The moment we draw anyone's attention,

2475
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:12,100
we have a problem.

2476
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:13,503
Oh, fuck.

2477
02:16:18,362 --> 02:16:19,542
Okay, we're close enough.

2478
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:22,043
I'm going to send Lyra
over with a tether now.

2479
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:24,237
This is going to be extremely fiddly.

2480
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:26,940
This ship isn't equipped
to pick up objects in space,

2481
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,198
so what we're going to do
is line up as good as we can

2482
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:32,639
and then slowly pull the
container in with a steel cable.

2483
02:16:33,405 --> 02:16:37,776
And pray it doesn't do too much damage
when it crashes into the cargo holds.

2484
02:16:42,156 --> 02:16:45,100
But if we don't get it disarmed first,

2485
02:16:45,125 --> 02:16:47,439
that will be the least
thing to worry about.

2486
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:49,234
Careful, Sina.

2487
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:50,885
I'm coming in now.

2488
02:16:55,698 --> 02:16:56,398
Oh,

2489
02:16:58,444 --> 02:17:00,976
this is a lot harder than it looks.

2490
02:17:06,092 --> 02:17:10,049
I have no idea how you always
make this look so effortless.

2491
02:17:14,813 --> 02:17:15,697
So,

2492
02:17:16,642 --> 02:17:18,615
making any progress down there?

2493
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:20,160
Not really.

2494
02:17:23,675 --> 02:17:24,895
Keep trying.

2495
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:29,593
Sorin wants me to weld the hook to one of
the support beams so he can attach a tether.

2496
02:17:29,804 --> 02:17:32,101
Have you ever used a welder in space?

2497
02:17:32,282 --> 02:17:33,443
Uh, nope.

2498
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:34,650
Oh, shit.

2499
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:35,735
Okay,

2500
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:36,555
hold on then.

2501
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:37,240
I will do it.

2502
02:17:48,927 --> 02:17:51,377
Uh, my ladies, I'm afraid
we're getting company.

2503
02:17:57,024 --> 02:18:00,247
What the fuck are they
trying to accomplish?

2504
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:04,394
Uh, there's someone coming
from the other ship, even.

2505
02:18:04,708 --> 02:18:07,116
Quick, grab the tether
and I'll pull you both back in.

2506
02:18:07,208 --> 02:18:09,053
I'm not going anywhere.

2507
02:18:23,623 --> 02:18:26,840
If they want their bomb back,

2508
02:18:27,707 --> 02:18:30,460
they'll have to take it from my cold,

2509
02:18:30,837 --> 02:18:32,397
dead hand.

2510
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:33,440
No,

2511
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:37,958
Lyra! Lyra, get back over
here! That thing is hydraulic.

2512
02:18:38,046 --> 02:18:39,941
It's a million times stronger than you.

2513
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:43,415
Lyra,

2514
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:44,620
he's got a gun!

2515
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:46,796
We need to get out of here.

2516
02:18:48,883 --> 02:18:49,843
Oh, shit!

2517
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:57,479
This will be our last chance to bail out.

2518
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:59,241
Give me the end of the tether.

2519
02:19:00,206 --> 02:19:00,835
No,

2520
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:01,425
wait.

2521
02:19:02,077 --> 02:19:02,797
Take it.

2522
02:19:03,032 --> 02:19:04,797
But I'm not going with you.

2523
02:19:05,620 --> 02:19:06,182
What?

2524
02:19:06,620 --> 02:19:07,732
I have an idea.

2525
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,670
What the fuck are you doing?

2526
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:11,278
You know what, Sina?

2527
02:19:12,123 --> 02:19:13,243
You were right.

2528
02:19:14,184 --> 02:19:18,381
When I began snooping on you and
your history with Albio and your parents,

2529
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:20,540
I didn't really care about you.

2530
02:19:22,151 --> 02:19:23,530
But things have changed.

2531
02:19:24,653 --> 02:19:26,253
I do care now.

2532
02:19:26,640 --> 02:19:27,860
I owe you this.

2533
02:19:36,111 --> 02:19:36,658
Here.

2534
02:19:38,068 --> 02:19:41,600
Hold the welder and
take care of the tether,

2535
02:19:41,816 --> 02:19:42,456
okay?

2536
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:46,256
You don't have to do this.

2537
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:47,900
But I want to.

2538
02:20:11,654 --> 02:20:12,400
Shit!

2539
02:20:14,176 --> 02:20:15,892
I think I cracked the rib.

2540
02:20:18,356 --> 02:20:21,362
You better get this thing
installed before it comes back.

2541
02:20:22,294 --> 02:20:23,675
Yeah, I've tried everything.

2542
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:25,589
It refuses to scan my paw.

2543
02:20:25,784 --> 02:20:27,753
How drunk were you when you set it up?

2544
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:29,500
I don't even remember doing it.

2545
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:31,482
Have you tried the other paw?

2546
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:32,061
What?

2547
02:20:32,420 --> 02:20:35,495
-The other paw!
-Why should I scan my other paw?

2548
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:36,440
Just do it!

2549
02:20:37,144 --> 02:20:37,848
Okay.

2550
02:20:49,241 --> 02:20:50,215
Sina?

2551
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:50,920
Did you do it?

2552
02:20:50,974 --> 02:20:52,720
Yes, it's safe.

2553
02:20:53,340 --> 02:20:54,558
Let's get out of here.

2554
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:55,590
All right.

2555
02:20:57,930 --> 02:20:58,930
Lyra!

2556
02:21:03,424 --> 02:21:04,929
It's crushing me!

2557
02:21:05,794 --> 02:21:07,743
Lyra! Lyra!

2558
02:21:08,885 --> 02:21:09,845
Hold on!

2559
02:21:10,258 --> 02:21:11,878
What the fuck is going on down here?

2560
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:14,142
Come on!

2561
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:19,198
Let her go, you stupid thing!

2562
02:21:23,788 --> 02:21:24,668
There we go.

2563
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:25,548
Lyra!

2564
02:21:26,514 --> 02:21:27,634
Lyra!

2565
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:29,100
Lyra, can you hear me?

2566
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:37,208
Sorin! Lyra is hurt! Call
emergency services!

2567
02:21:38,005 --> 02:21:40,112
We'll be ready to come back
to the ship in a minute!

2568
02:21:40,138 --> 02:21:40,916
All right!

2569
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:42,115
Let me know when.

2570
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:47,664
Not so fast, Sina!

2571
02:21:47,946 --> 02:21:49,906
Lyra! Are you okay?

2572
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:53,643
Everything hurts, but I think I'll live.

2573
02:21:55,309 --> 02:21:57,967
I never thought I would be
so glad to hear your voice.

2574
02:21:58,240 --> 02:21:59,015
Hang in there.

2575
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:00,022
We're going back.

2576
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:04,105
You thought I'd miss the chance
to ride the bomb back home?

2577
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:05,327
No way!

2578
02:22:07,994 --> 02:22:11,104
You are so much braver than I will ever be.

2579
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:12,216
All right.

2580
02:22:12,511 --> 02:22:13,339
Here we go.

2581
02:22:20,674 --> 02:22:21,274
There.

2582
02:22:21,715 --> 02:22:23,055
That will do the job.

2583
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:24,867
Sorin, we're ready to go.

2584
02:22:25,060 --> 02:22:26,550
Pull us in, but gently.

2585
02:22:26,575 --> 02:22:27,324
Well then,

2586
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:28,834
here goes nothing.

2587
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:29,733
Three,

2588
02:22:30,150 --> 02:22:30,789
two,

2589
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:32,805
one, go!

2590
02:22:59,397 --> 02:23:00,558
Breaking news!

2591
02:23:00,899 --> 02:23:03,081
Convicted former freelance
journalist survives the

2592
02:23:03,105 --> 02:23:05,780
hijacking of her prisoner
transport vessel by a terrorist,

2593
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:08,419
and not only saves the
Pioneers from having

2594
02:23:08,443 --> 02:23:11,062
Juno Station destroyed
by an antimatter bomb,

2595
02:23:11,320 --> 02:23:14,260
but also delivers it safely
back to its rightful owners,

2596
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:17,873
while uncovering a system-wide
conspiracy between the various

2597
02:23:17,898 --> 02:23:22,589
UN agencies and the system's
largest mining corporation, ERG.

2598
02:23:22,962 --> 02:23:27,266
And if you think that headline was
quite a mouthful, you're absolutely right.

2599
02:23:27,480 --> 02:23:30,076
Our colleague, Frayden
Schultz, who has just returned

2600
02:23:30,101 --> 02:23:32,567
from the press conference
at the President's office,

2601
02:23:32,632 --> 02:23:35,100
will hopefully be able to break it down for us.

2602
02:23:40,904 --> 02:23:44,010
Yes, Simon, I think it is
safe to say that this is the

2603
02:23:44,034 --> 02:23:47,279
biggest scandal that has
ever rocked the solar system.

2604
02:23:47,884 --> 02:23:52,155
We all remember the Supreme Court's landmark
decision that the independent settlement

2605
02:23:52,180 --> 02:23:55,563
on Juno does not fall
under Earth jurisdiction,

2606
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:58,655
and fundamental human
rights prohibited UN military

2607
02:23:58,680 --> 02:24:03,108
to intervene unless there are
signs of an actual threat to the UN.

2608
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:04,227
Today,

2609
02:24:04,265 --> 02:24:08,557
mounting evidence was
revealed that ERG officials,

2610
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:13,617
who had strongly pushed towards a
military intervention against the Pioneers,

2611
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:16,733
tried to take the situation
into their own hands.

2612
02:24:17,540 --> 02:24:18,350
Apparently,

2613
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:21,121
they helped a terrorist
to illegally acquire an

2614
02:24:21,146 --> 02:24:24,600
antimatter bomb and
sent him to destroy Juno.

2615
02:24:24,625 --> 02:24:27,409
That almost sounds like the
plan of a cartoon super villain.

2616
02:24:27,504 --> 02:24:28,635
Absolutely,

2617
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:32,084
and the amount of collusion necessary
to make this happen is staggering.

2618
02:24:32,260 --> 02:24:36,963
But all it took to topple this house
of cards was one single eyewitness.

2619
02:24:37,180 --> 02:24:40,261
Her testimony has already
been recorded two weeks ago,

2620
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:41,920
but the investigation has been

2621
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:44,516
kept secret until this morning,

2622
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:48,921
the UN Guard conducted a
simultaneous concerted crackdown

2623
02:24:48,946 --> 02:24:52,039
on various ERG and government offices.

2624
02:24:52,106 --> 02:24:53,306
Many officials,

2625
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:58,514
including ERG's fleet officer Theodor
Copland and BI chief Henry Lewis,

2626
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:00,882
are now facing charges of corruption,

2627
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,816
25 cases of murder,

2628
02:25:02,980 --> 02:25:05,734
more than 500 cases of attempted murder,

2629
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:08,231
illegal weapons trade, terrorism,

2630
02:25:08,279 --> 02:25:10,659
treason and many more.

2631
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:13,388
Did the president give
us any perspective

2632
02:25:13,413 --> 02:25:15,939
on what the consequences might
be within the government?

2633
02:25:16,020 --> 02:25:18,408
UN President Garza
said he is shocked and

2634
02:25:18,432 --> 02:25:21,835
appalled by the recent
events and that parliament

2635
02:25:21,891 --> 02:25:24,232
is already in session
to determine which

2636
02:25:24,256 --> 02:25:27,140
reforms need to be
enacted in order to prevent

2637
02:25:27,140 --> 02:25:28,980
something like this to happen again.

2638
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:32,736
This will also definitely
have a huge impact on

2639
02:25:32,761 --> 02:25:38,703
the ongoing antitrust proceedings against
ERG and it's very likely the last straw

2640
02:25:38,735 --> 02:25:43,135
it will take to finally break
up the ERG monopoly.

2641
02:25:43,320 --> 02:25:45,284
Now tell me a bit about the eyewitness,

2642
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:47,360
who is she and how did she get involved?

2643
02:25:47,442 --> 02:25:50,081
This is another story
straight out of Hollywood.

2644
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:51,622
Her name is Lyra Senick,

2645
02:25:51,647 --> 02:25:53,802
a journalist from Boston Massachusetts,

2646
02:25:53,855 --> 02:25:58,113
sentenced to forced labor on
Vesta for trying to uncover part

2647
02:25:58,138 --> 02:25:59,998
of this very conspiracy.

2648
02:26:00,404 --> 02:26:04,006
She miraculously survived the
hijacking of the ERG ship

2649
02:26:04,031 --> 02:26:05,448
she was on in Cryo,

2650
02:26:05,820 --> 02:26:10,380
managed to overwhelm the hijacker and took
the ship to Juno station to get help.

2651
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:14,010
What happened after that
is still classified information,

2652
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:16,680
but if a full story is ever
going to be released,

2653
02:26:17,140 --> 02:26:19,800
it'll be one for the
history books for sure.

2654
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:21,660
Thanks a lot Brayden Schultz,

2655
02:26:21,741 --> 02:26:24,666
we'll continue to check in
with you as the story develops.

2656
02:26:24,691 --> 02:26:25,611
You're welcome.

2657
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:28,581
Now back to Inside Politics.

2658
02:26:43,669 --> 02:26:46,913
Telling the truth to those
in power should neither

2659
02:26:46,937 --> 02:26:50,987
be a revolutionary act
nor should it be a sacrifice.

2660
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:53,186
But it still is.

2661
02:26:53,557 --> 02:26:55,320
When I dared to tell the truth,

2662
02:26:55,472 --> 02:26:58,955
I was framed and shipped to
Vesta for a crime I did not commit.

2663
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:03,080
But I think if more of us
chose to speak the truth,

2664
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:05,256
we would be in a better place right now.

2665
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:08,755
So it is our job, our obligation,

2666
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:11,605
our duty to speak truth to power.

2667
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,460
Not just when it's difficult,

2668
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:15,666
but especially when it's difficult.

2669
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:16,740
Thank you.

2670
02:27:26,713 --> 02:27:28,292
If you want to know more,

2671
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:33,002
please buy my book "JUNO
RISING" and learn how the former ERG

2672
02:27:33,027 --> 02:27:36,007
tried to go to war against those
who dared to think different.

2673
02:27:36,479 --> 02:27:37,759
If you already have a copy,

2674
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:40,716
you can get it signed at
the terminal by the stage.

2675
02:28:02,038 --> 02:28:03,418
Oh, uh, hey Lyra.

2676
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:05,260
I'd love to talk to you in real time,

2677
02:28:05,380 --> 02:28:07,825
but you know, the speed
of light is against us.

2678
02:28:08,380 --> 02:28:10,087
I hope your TAD talk went well.

2679
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:12,135
I bet you were nervous as hell,

2680
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:14,560
but I'm sure you absolutely
nailed it as always.

2681
02:28:15,180 --> 02:28:16,755
I'm sorry I can't be there in person,

2682
02:28:16,780 --> 02:28:17,960
but as you can imagine,

2683
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:19,416
I'm needed here more than ever.

2684
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:22,144
It's Sally's first day back
at home and we're still

2685
02:28:22,169 --> 02:28:24,579
getting used to having a
little cub in the house again.

2686
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:26,440
Hey sweetheart,

2687
02:28:26,648 --> 02:28:27,835
can you come over for a second?

2688
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:29,314
I'm recording a message for Lyra.

2689
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:35,889
Lyra,

2690
02:28:37,180 --> 02:28:38,053
meet Maya.

2691
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:41,574
Isn't she beautiful?

2692
02:28:44,546 --> 02:28:46,846
She's all I ever dreamed of,
and without you,

2693
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:48,800
she would never have seen the light of day.

2694
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:50,073
And for that,

2695
02:28:50,466 --> 02:28:51,927
we will forever thank you.

2696
02:28:52,649 --> 02:28:56,167
I hope you can overcome your fear of space
again and be able to come over for a visit.

2697
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:57,592
We miss you.

2698
02:28:57,820 --> 02:28:58,605
Take care.

2699
02:28:58,892 --> 02:28:59,500
Sorin,

2700
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:00,420
out.

2701
02:29:02,794 --> 02:29:04,828
She's so cute.

2702
02:29:13,810 --> 02:29:15,655
Dear TAD attendees,

2703
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:20,280
we would like to announce that the buffet
is now open in the planetary ballroom.

2704
02:29:43,173 --> 02:29:44,837
Hello.

2705
02:29:45,853 --> 02:29:47,197
Where is everybody?

2706
02:29:49,109 --> 02:29:50,045
Hello.

2707
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:53,256
Oh well.

2708
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:54,859
Why should Lyra Senick,

2709
02:29:54,884 --> 02:29:56,635
New York Times bestseller author,

2710
02:29:56,660 --> 02:29:58,180
care for an old man like me?

2711
02:29:58,205 --> 02:30:00,120
She's a celebrity now after all.

2712
02:30:01,231 --> 02:30:03,084
Who gives a damn about old friends?

2713
02:30:10,109 --> 02:30:11,115
Lyra?

2714
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:14,359
You're standing on my tail!

2715
02:30:14,384 --> 02:30:15,866
Oh, I'm sorry.

2716
02:30:15,891 --> 02:30:16,529
I'm sorry.

2717
02:30:17,726 --> 02:30:18,626
Apparently,

2718
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:21,604
the autopilot thought you
were part of the furniture.

2719
02:30:25,212 --> 02:30:28,131
You're the last one I
expected to show up here.

2720
02:30:28,772 --> 02:30:30,957
So, how have you been?

2721
02:30:31,132 --> 02:30:31,958
Or rather,

2722
02:30:32,072 --> 02:30:33,386
where have you been?

2723
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:35,557
I thought you were gone for good.

2724
02:30:36,229 --> 02:30:38,351
I'm sorry I had to leave so suddenly,

2725
02:30:38,376 --> 02:30:41,671
but nuking my station got
me a lot of unwanted attention.

2726
02:30:42,220 --> 02:30:44,080
I had to go underground
for a while to fix my

2727
02:30:44,104 --> 02:30:46,607
business and make
sure I lived to tell the tale.

2728
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:50,088
But I'm glad I still managed to
hook you up with the Stillwaters.

2729
02:30:50,680 --> 02:30:53,554
Life wouldn't have been the
same if the bomb went off.

2730
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:55,830
I never got to thank you for that.

2731
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:58,059
Is there anybody you don't know?

2732
02:30:59,277 --> 02:31:01,417
It's just a rhetorical question.

2733
02:31:02,121 --> 02:31:04,226
So, how did you like my talk?

2734
02:31:04,274 --> 02:31:04,695
Oh,

2735
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:07,622
I loved it! I even bought
a copy of your book.

2736
02:31:08,020 --> 02:31:11,360
I hope it has pictures of Sina's
face when her parents showed up.

2737
02:31:12,570 --> 02:31:13,740
I'm afraid not.

2738
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:16,085
But if you come over to the terminal,

2739
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:18,180
I can even put in a dedication for you.

2740
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:20,040
No, thank you.

2741
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:21,840
But if I wanted a digital signature,

2742
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,420
I could just forge one myself.

2743
02:31:26,810 --> 02:31:29,420
Can I have an old-fashioned one instead?

2744
02:31:29,544 --> 02:31:31,073
One with a pen?

2745
02:31:31,375 --> 02:31:32,548
On an e-book?

2746
02:31:32,834 --> 02:31:34,877
How's that supposed to work?

2747
02:31:34,902 --> 02:31:37,099
No, not on an e-book, silly.

2748
02:31:40,195 --> 02:31:40,695
Here,

2749
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:42,371
I printed it all out.

2750
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:43,438
Oh,

2751
02:31:44,383 --> 02:31:46,003
okay.

2752
02:31:52,961 --> 02:31:55,740
To Link Kabanshee, my old friend.

2753
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,469
Sorry for the station.

2754
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:59,727
I'll buy you a new one as soon as I can.

2755
02:32:00,084 --> 02:32:00,625
Yours,

2756
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:01,529
Lyra.

2757
02:32:02,426 --> 02:32:03,435
Wonderful,

2758
02:32:03,460 --> 02:32:04,220
thank you.

2759
02:32:06,442 --> 02:32:08,736
So, have you set up a new shop yet?

2760
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:11,868
Yes and no.

2761
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:15,192
I have managed to score an
old CommNet relay in the belt.

2762
02:32:15,271 --> 02:32:18,244
And we are building the
first off-world data center.

2763
02:32:18,540 --> 02:32:20,710
EMP-hardened, tax-free,

2764
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:22,534
privacy guaranteed.

2765
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:24,360
And what did you call it?

2766
02:32:24,499 --> 02:32:26,150
The Pirate Bay?

2767
02:32:28,248 --> 02:32:30,758
I like the ring of that.

2768
02:32:45,047 --> 02:32:45,999
Lyra!

2769
02:32:46,492 --> 02:32:47,530
Sina!

2770
02:32:49,729 --> 02:32:51,565
-Link!
-John!

2771
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:54,748
-Meredith!
-Lyra!
-Link!

2772
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,445
-Sina!
-John!
-Lyra!

2773
02:32:57,470 --> 02:32:59,255
-Link!
-Meredith!

2774
02:32:59,389 --> 02:33:00,209
Janet!

2775
02:33:00,234 --> 02:33:03,439
-Dr. Scott!
-Brad!
-Rocky!

2776
02:33:17,092 --> 02:33:18,660
Sorry for letting you guys wait,

2777
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:21,840
but I just ran into
this old guy here.

2778
02:33:22,100 --> 02:33:22,826
Or rather,

2779
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:25,020
he ran into me.

2780
02:33:26,063 --> 02:33:27,774
Okay, then let's go eat.

2781
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:31,226
The buffet has some real veggies and meat.

2782
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:33,240
You don't get much good food on Juno,

2783
02:33:33,267 --> 02:33:33,857
do you?

2784
02:33:34,612 --> 02:33:37,281
I think there is still some
chocolate pudding left.

2785
02:33:39,531 --> 02:33:40,651
But seriously,

2786
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:45,772
the food situation has improved so much
since we don't have to smuggle it anymore.

2787
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:49,506
The Pioneers have never had
a better relationship with Earth.

2788
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:51,334
We have an embassy now.

2789
02:33:51,420 --> 02:33:52,911
We can legally trade.

2790
02:33:53,908 --> 02:33:55,966
We have our own CommNet domain.

2791
02:33:56,093 --> 02:33:59,835
And all thanks to the political
fallout of the ERG scandal.

2792
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:05,414
Whoever came up with the idea to attack us
got the exact opposite of what they wanted.

2793
02:34:05,860 --> 02:34:07,895
Karma is a bitch.

2794
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:08,825
Hell yeah.

2795
02:34:09,961 --> 02:34:11,961
And it even gets better.

2796
02:34:12,220 --> 02:34:16,440
Juno Station is going to be
100% legal by the end of the month.

2797
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:21,560
And that clears the last barrier of
our acceptance as a sovereign nation.

2798
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:23,960
Wow! How did that happen?

2799
02:34:25,921 --> 02:34:27,828
I will let you in on a secret.

2800
02:34:28,686 --> 02:34:33,174
You know, the UN decided to
break up the ERG monopoly, right?

2801
02:34:34,288 --> 02:34:37,503
A little bird sang to me
which of the new companies

2802
02:34:37,527 --> 02:34:40,355
will be the legal owner
of Juno Station.

2803
02:34:40,380 --> 02:34:45,600
And another little birdie sang to
me that the stocks will be dirt cheap.

2804
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:46,695
What?

2805
02:34:46,720 --> 02:34:48,658
You actually bought Juno?

2806
02:34:49,300 --> 02:34:51,660
A lot more than just Juno, but

2807
02:34:52,832 --> 02:34:54,535
the deal is still in progress.

2808
02:34:56,929 --> 02:34:58,775
Hey! No insider trading!

2809
02:34:58,800 --> 02:34:59,195
What?

2810
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:00,640
I was just checking my email.

2811
02:35:03,812 --> 02:35:05,452
That's so awesome!

2812
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:07,054
I'm so happy for you!

2813
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:09,745
Where did all the money suddenly come from?

2814
02:35:10,100 --> 02:35:13,692
I sold all my stocks in Stillwater
Dynamics and set up a fund.

2815
02:35:14,003 --> 02:35:15,203
It wasn't an easy decision,

2816
02:35:15,228 --> 02:35:18,212
but the bomb incident
was quite a rude awakening.

2817
02:35:18,540 --> 02:35:19,615
I think in the end,

2818
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:23,247
the Pioneers will help our freedom
more than weapons ever could.

2819
02:35:24,156 --> 02:35:24,650
Yeah.

2820
02:35:25,236 --> 02:35:25,921
And so,

2821
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:27,695
are we going for lunch or not?

2822
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:29,003
I'm starving!

2823
02:35:29,825 --> 02:35:31,355
Sure, let's go.

2824
02:35:31,498 --> 02:35:31,978
Okay.

2825
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:34,380
Earth food, here I come!

2826
02:35:36,981 --> 02:35:39,671
I would never have imagined
ever hear you say that.

2827
02:35:42,786 --> 02:35:44,486
What the hell?

2828
02:35:48,268 --> 02:35:51,100
Oh, for fuck's sake, not now!

2829
02:35:51,362 --> 02:35:53,194
I'll be with you in a minute.

2830
02:35:55,793 --> 02:35:58,353
Brian!

2831
02:35:59,943 --> 02:36:03,013
The bloody chair ain't working!

2832
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:04,620
Brian?

2833
02:36:06,002 --> 02:36:08,395
Have you tried turning it off and on again?

2834
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:10,898
Of course I did!

2835
02:36:12,136 --> 02:36:14,443
Maybe the stem bolt didn't steer properly?

2836
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:17,940
And what can I do about that?

2837
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:20,082
Eh, nothing?

2838
02:36:20,177 --> 02:36:22,591
Oh, come on, you piece of junk!

2839
02:36:25,288 --> 02:36:26,088
Eh,

2840
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:29,991
Link! Link, you really shouldn't
do that! It's a wheelchair,

2841
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:32,635
not a tank! Link! No!

2842
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:37,427
Oh, who gives a shit about
experts' opinion nowadays?

2843
02:36:37,604 --> 02:36:38,644
Good luck!

2844
02:36:44,930 --> 02:36:46,195
Finally!

2845
02:36:46,220 --> 02:36:48,620
Standby for ignition in five,

2846
02:36:49,286 --> 02:36:49,866
four,

2847
02:36:50,316 --> 02:36:50,879
three,

02:36:51,033 --> 02:36:51,550
two,

02:36:51,748 --> 02:36:52,277
