1
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:19,966
Lonely.

2
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,661
I feel so lonely.

3
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,569
Days, years, centuries.

4
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:35,179
I've been waiting for so long...

5
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:37,729
that time has become indifferent to me

6
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,919
All that still warms my heart...

7
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,039
are memories of days that long passed.

8
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:48,949
The days when I used to bring
joy and happiness to the world

9
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:51,869
Why do they no longer call me?

10
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,089
Do they no longer need me?

11
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:57,055
Do they no longer want me?

12
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:01,511
What a cold, cruel place
the world must have become.

13
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:04,592
What new age is dawning...

14
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,249
now the age of song
seems to have ended?

15
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:10,048
Is this my end?

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,720
Lonely.

17
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,839
I feel so lonely.

18
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:18,242
I want to sing!
I want to dance!

19
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,519
I want to... no!
I must be free!

20
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,019
Oh, mortals!

21
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:27,589
Unlock the gate and let me free!

22
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:29,059
Please!

23
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:31,149
Don't let me be forgotten!

24
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,219
Is everyone ready?
Does everybody have a drink?

25
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:49,939
- Yes!
- Sure!

26
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:53,069
Switch the lights off!
Switch the lights off!

27
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,199
- Wait, is the CD in the player?
- Way ahead of you!

28
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:01,829
Quick, quick!

29
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:05,119
He could be here any minute!

30
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:07,159
Where is the Mountain Dew?

31
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,200
It's in the fridge.

32
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:14,552
Shh! Shh! I think he's coming!

33
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:17,709
- How old is he getting anyway?
- Shh! Quiet!

34
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,369
Hello? Hello?

35
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,189
Is anybody home?

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,950
Why are the lights out?

37
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,619
Ouch! Uh! What the...?
Who left this... Uh...

38
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,797
What was this?

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,909
Happy Birthday to you!

40
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:42,790
Happy Birthday to you!

41
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,200
Happy Birthday, dear Lionel!

42
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:49,629
Happy Birthday to you!

43
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:51,959
Happy Birthday, Lionel!

44
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:53,509
Wow!

45
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:59,789
Wow, you guys are throwing a
surprise party! Just for me?

46
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,817
Aww... you shouldn't have.

47
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,536
I don't know what to say, I... I...

48
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,849
Congratulations, Lionel!

49
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:06,769
Thank you!

50
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,579
Yeah, congratulations!

51
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:09,377
Thank you!

52
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:11,589
Thank you very much!

53
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,309
Who arranged all this?

54
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:14,909
Oh, it was Lori's idea.

55
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:17,949
I hope you like it.

56
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:20,009
Yes, Lori, it's wonderful!

57
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,379
But where is Poke?

58
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,839
Did he forget my birthday again?

59
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:28,359
Oh, this is a party.
Of course he's going to come!

60
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:31,109
He said he's going to be
a little late, though.

61
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:32,452
Ah, okay.

62
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:35,769
So, who wants to have some fun?

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,769
Yeah!

64
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:57,759
Hey, turn the music down, please!
I got a phone call!

65
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,049
Uh, guys? This could be important!
Please!

66
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,281
Hello?

67
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:08,879
Yes?

68
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,879
Yes, that's me!

69
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:15,749
What?

70
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:18,689
Do you... I...

71
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:20,409
Oh, shit!

72
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:22,329
Yes, yes, I understand.

73
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:23,729
Where?

74
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:26,639
The museum of - what?

75
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,859
I'm sorry, I'm still a bit...

76
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:31,769
Can I call you back?

77
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:32,929
Thank you.

78
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,589
Yes, I'll see into it. Goodbye!

79
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,019
Lionel... what's up with you?

80
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:45,069
Yes. Yes, you sound like,

81
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:46,899
there's something wrong.

82
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,619
Yes, Lori. Actually there is.

83
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,129
I've just been informed that my...

84
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:55,369
father has passed away last night.

85
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,379
Oh Lionel! I'm so sorry!

86
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,189
If... If there's anything I can do...

87
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:06,949
N-No. No thank you. Thank you.

88
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,229
It's alright.

89
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,089
It just took me a bit by surprise.
Don't worry.

90
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:17,369
Lionel... I don't know what to say.
I'm so sorry! I...

91
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,199
Happy Birthday to you!

92
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:25,283
Happy Birthday to you!

93
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:30,209
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to you!

94
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,162
Hey!

95
00:05:32,106 --> 00:05:35,029
Lionel! You da man!

96
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,229
One year more and you still
look beau-ti-ful!

97
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,249
Look!
I just stole those flowers for you!

98
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:44,104
Poke! Poke, shut up!

99
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:46,709
Oh, Lori! What's up with you?

100
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:50,289
This is his birthday party,
not a funeral, you know?

101
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:51,749
Par-ty!

102
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,589
I know this whole concept is
new to you, but...

103
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,019
Oh, cut it out!

104
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,399
Alright. What's wrong?

105
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,659
Lionel's father is dead.

106
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:05,979
What do you mean, "dead"?

107
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:08,396
When did that happen? And how?

108
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,239
I just got a phone call.

109
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,769
He passed away in his sleep last night.

110
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:18,299
I'm sorry folks. The party is over.

111
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,939
Thank you all for coming but...

112
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:22,399
I think Lionel wants to be alone now.

113
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,161
Aww...

114
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,499
- Bye! -Bye!
- See you guys!

115
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,509
So...

116
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:35,609
So...

117
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:50,629
So the old fart has
finally hit the bucket!

118
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,419
But life goes on!

119
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:54,999
It's still my birthday.

120
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:58,319
and I'd really like to celebrate
with you guys and...

121
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,149
Oh, dear.

122
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,119
I should have kept my mouth shut,
shouldn't I?

123
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:05,329
Lionel, I'm shocked!

124
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:08,012
Why are you talking about him
like that?

125
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:11,659
Yes! You almost sound like
you don't care he's dead.

126
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,309
No, it's not that it's just...

127
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:18,279
Frankly, I don't miss him that much.

128
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:19,841
I haven't heard anything from him...

129
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:22,319
since he left more than ten years ago.

130
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:24,259
But he's family!

131
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:26,562
What's been going on
between you and him?

132
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:29,069
Nothing! That's exactly the problem!

133
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,899
Nothing has been going on.

134
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,690
He decided to leave me behind...

135
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:34,999
and chase his stupid fantasies instead.

136
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,939
And I had to find a place
to live for myself.

137
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,109
And believe me, that wasn't easy...

138
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:41,899
since he didn't leave me any money.

139
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,629
And everything else he owned, he sold!

140
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:45,879
That's hard to believe.

141
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,369
Yes. Uh, why did he go?

142
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,329
I don't know...

143
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,909
He told me I would understand
some day but...

144
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,279
that day hasn't come yet.

145
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,879
And now that he's dead
it's probably too late.

146
00:07:57,596 --> 00:08:01,061
I could have been the son of a
famous musician but... No!

147
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,519
He prefered digging in the dirt instead!

148
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,297
In the dirt?

149
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,879
A musician?

150
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:08,619
What was your father's job?

151
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:11,524
He was a singer and a songwriter.

152
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,339
And he was doing really well!

153
00:08:13,596 --> 00:08:16,709
I swear, he was that close
to his breakthrough!

154
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:19,109
His songs were playing on all stations!

155
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:21,689
He was just about to sign
the big contract...

156
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:22,899
And then he quit!

157
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,939
He decided to become...

158
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,499
an archaeologist!

159
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,789
Got that? An archaeologist!

160
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:31,539
That must have been the
single most stupid decision...

161
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:32,689
ever made on earth!

162
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,889
He threw away a perfect career
out of pure selfishness!

163
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:40,079
He didn't care the slightest bit
about the consequences...

164
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,909
I had to face!

165
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:45,209
And what are you supposed to do now?

166
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:49,029
They want me to come to Cairo
to accept my heritage.

167
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,142
For some reason my father insisted...

168
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,909
that I have to go and
pick it up in person.

169
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,699
But I'm not sure I really want to.

170
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,139
I mean, what could a guy like him
leave me anyway?

171
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:01,289
A bucket of sand and a shovel?

172
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,009
Why Cairo?

173
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:08,839
Because, obviously that was the place
where he used to live.

174
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:12,132
He was working for the
"Museum of Forgotten Arts".

175
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,859
Whatever that might be.

176
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:16,699
I've never heard about this
institution before...

177
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:18,919
but it sure sounds like Dad.

178
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:21,769
No matter what you think of him...

179
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,129
You've got to pay your last
respect to him.

180
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,759
You can't just dismiss him like that.

181
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,279
This wouldn't make you
any better than him.

182
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:31,824
And maybe it is worth the effort.

183
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,009
I mean, they wouldn't make you
show up personally...

184
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:37,319
if it wan't important, don't you think?

185
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,819
Yes! We're going to Cairo!

186
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:42,269
We're going to
walk like an Egyptian!

187
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:44,159
Walk like an Egyptian!

188
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:45,989
Walk like an Egyptian!

189
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,849
Wait wait! Wait a minute!
Who said, "we"?

190
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:52,229
I said, "we". I mean,
we ought to stick together, right?

191
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,599
And I can't wait to meet the bit- uh,

192
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,379
see the lovely beaches, you know...

193
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,809
sand... and the like...

194
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:00,669
Poke...

195
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:03,079
There is no beach in Cairo.

196
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:07,209
I always wanted to see the
"Museum of Forgotten Arts".

197
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:11,489
Oh Lori, five minutes ago you didn't
even know this museum existed!

198
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,199
Don't you get it?

199
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,939
We're your friends, and we just
want to be with you.

200
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,129
Oh Mika, that's so sweet.

201
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:21,369
Alright.

202
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:23,399
I guess I don't have another
choice then.

203
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:25,489
But, guys, please keep in mind...

204
00:10:25,546 --> 00:10:28,619
that this is not a vacation.
We've got serious business to do.

205
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,969
Let's get packing.

206
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,583
Walk like an Egyptian!

207
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,560
Walk like an Egyptian!

208
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:36,479
Walk like an Egyptian!

209
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,609
Walk like an Egyptian!

210
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,369
My Producer!

211
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:08,199
My Producer!

212
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:13,278
You called for me?

213
00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:15,119
Yes!

214
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,639
The meeting is due!

215
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:19,211
Send in the
Digital Rights Managers!

216
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,349
Ja, my Producer!

217
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,009
At once!

218
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:30,809
Of course, my Producer!

219
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:33,779
I'll get them for you,
my Producer!

220
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:57,709
At your service, oh mighty Producer!

221
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:00,489
Very well!

222
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:03,989
Gentlemen, I have called you
to this special meeting...

223
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,039
because I'm deeply disappointed!

224
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,499
I have just read the latest
sales report.

225
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,159
Our profit has increased by
fifty percent...

226
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,799
and this is way below the
expectations for this quarter.

227
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,589
I find this lack of growth...

228
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,269
disturbing.

229
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,439
How do you expect me to explain
this to our shareholders?

230
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:28,929
My Producer...

231
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:31,449
we... perhaps...well...

232
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:35,429
We are still doing a lot of
research in this field...

233
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:39,149
and it seems, people have become
strangely inspired lately.

234
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:42,569
Strangely inspired, you say...

235
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,079
That's hard to believe.

236
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,219
What do you have to
back up your claim?

237
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:49,529
My numbers indicate that
a lot of people are singing...

238
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:52,429
unlicenced material under the shower!

239
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:00,479
And I just received a report
of incidences of children...

240
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,279
in kindergartens being taught
public domain nursery songs.

241
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,679
Officially! By their teachers!

242
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,159
Imagine that!

243
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,319
Tsk... Disgusting! What's next?

244
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:13,689
Teachers giving away mp3 files
in their classrooms?

245
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,109
Don't you dare speak the
forbidden word!

246
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,859
Which one? "mp3"?

247
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:39,349
Idiot!

248
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,929
Don't say this again! You know what
the punishment is!

249
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:45,899
Ja, my Producer!

250
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,319
I thought that rule excludes
members of the corporation.

251
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:53,069
Silence, you fool!

252
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,529
What was I about to say?
Ah, yes!

253
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:02,579
It seems that the power of inspiration
is on the rise again.

254
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:06,799
This development has always been
my deepest concern.

255
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:09,909
All sources of inspiration are
under our control.

256
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:12,299
I don't understand how this can be.

257
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,569
Something must have happened.

258
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,219
Perhaps the rumors are true.

259
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,669
But no matter what,

260
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,339
we must take action. Quickly.

261
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,029
Firstly, about the people
singing under the shower.

262
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,069
Call our legal department.

263
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:31,279
We must exert our influence in
establishing new international...

264
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,459
copyright laws that will allow us to
demand compensation...

265
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,629
from the manufacturers of
bathroom equipment!

266
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:43,199
Brilliant idea, my Producer!

267
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,569
Then, about the children.

268
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,739
We must increase our presence
in schools and kindergartens...

269
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,949
teaching them that singing
public domain songs...

270
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,739
means depriving hard working
artists...

271
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:55,799
from their God-given right to profit!

272
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:59,979
We must educate them that
licencing is good...

273
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:02,319
and sharing is evil.

274
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,069
As you command, my Producer!

275
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:11,179
Okay... Now what are we going
to do with you?

276
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:16,029
What are you suggesting in order
to redeem yourself?

277
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:19,989
I... I beg your forgiveness,
my Producer!

278
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:21,829
I didn't mean to cause any harm!

279
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:23,469
Please! Have mercy!

280
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:28,059
I only said "mp..." that word two times...

281
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:29,659
and... and...

282
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,649
Yes. And?

283
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:36,369
And I promise, I will never
say "mp3" again!

284
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:42,939
Okay, that's enough! Three times!

285
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,239
Your behavior is intolerable!

286
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,519
- You shall receive your punishment!
- No!

287
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:51,299
What is your verdict, my Producer?

288
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,829
The punishment for saying the
forbidden word is...

289
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,499
Death!
By Britney's Spear!

290
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:06,599
No! No, not that! Please!

291
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,329
What a just decision, my Producer!

292
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,459
Britney!

293
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,609
Ja, my Producer?

294
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,359
Kill him!

295
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:33,159
My pleasure, my Producer!

296
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:04,549
Despicable!

297
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,779
Do we really sell this kind of music?

298
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:11,639
Yes, we do. And actually it's
quite successful!

299
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,139
I even got it as mp... uh...

300
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:17,379
I mean, Windows Media, yes,
Windows Media.

301
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,889
My Producer! My Producer!

302
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,789
We have tapped into a phone call...

303
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,639
from the "Museum of Forgotten Arts"
in Egypt.

304
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,359
We finally have the proof
that your theory is true.

305
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,979
The document really exists...

306
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:43,379
and the old Lion's son is already on
his way to claim his heritage.

307
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,639
Right on cue!

308
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:51,329
So... Mr. Scruffycat senior
really found it!

309
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:53,019
Remarkable.

310
00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:56,279
And now he's trying to pass it on
to his son.

311
00:17:56,719 --> 00:18:00,249
I always knew he couldn't keep
a secret to himself.

312
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:03,439
Too bad for him. Good for us, though.

313
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,919
Send two of our best men to Cairo
and get it before he does!

314
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:11,369
It's the key to gaining control over
all music on this planet!

315
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:13,889
And we must not miss this opportunity!

316
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,979
Ja, my Producer!

317
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:19,949
Christopher Scruffycat!

318
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:24,549
You have tried to cross my plans
so many times...

319
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:26,109
but not tis time!

320
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:30,459
When all this is over I'll be
the richest man in the world!

321
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:33,489
Thank you, old Lion.

322
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:36,139
I wouldn't have made it without you!

323
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,569
Salaam Alaykum!

324
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:18,059
Welcome to the "Museum of
Forgotten Arts" my honored friends.

325
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,639
My name is Yussef Al-Kali.
I have been waiting for you.

326
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:23,859
Alaykum Salaam.

327
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,929
Hi dude! Al-Kali?

328
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,779
Aren't you that guy who invented
the Energizer Bunny?

329
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,479
I mean last time I put the
batteries in backwards...

330
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,939
and it kept coming, and coming,
and coming...

331
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:41,109
Poke! That's not the way to
greet a man like him!

332
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,429
Let me show you how it's done.

333
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:50,099
Alaykum Salaam, Yussef Al-Kali!
My name is Loreena McFolkmanis...

334
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:52,909
and my friends and I thank you
for your warm welcome.

335
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,129
You are equally welcome!

336
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:57,889
Why don't you and your friends
come over and sit down with me?

337
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,349
It's the customs of my people
to offer guests a nice cup of...

338
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:03,939
arabian mocha as a gesture
of hospitality.

339
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:07,369
Ah, coffee! Just what I need right now!

340
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:08,699
Gimme that!

341
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:12,799
Poke, be careful! This is real
arabian mocha!

342
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:17,159
Yes, and it's inside the smallest cup
I've ever seen.

343
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,959
No challenge for me. Starbuck's is
my middle name!

344
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:32,259
Yeah! That's the real stuff!

345
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:35,439
Keeps your heart beating
and your paws black!

346
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:43,649
Uh oh... I never tried this before.

347
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,279
I wouldn't touch it if I were you.

348
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,059
This is not the decaf, fat-free,
low-carb dish water you always sip on!

349
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,159
This is for real men, not for
little girls like you.

350
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:58,549
Hey, calm down macho-man! We're
tough girls, we can handle this!

351
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:02,489
And we don't want to be impolite,
do we, Lori?

352
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:09,429
Uh... I guess... no.

353
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:12,559
Maybe it's not so bad.

354
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:24,719
Hey... Hey, that's really nice!
I... I could really...

355
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,789
Anybody else want some mocha?

356
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,789
- No!
- No!

357
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:06,469
Two cubes of sugar, please!

358
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:13,669
All right. I'm sure you're curious
why you had to come here in person...

359
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:15,609
and what your father might
have left you.

360
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:19,499
The passing of your father has been
a great loss to all of us.

361
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:23,509
He did great things for the museum
and found many artifacts...

362
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:26,139
that were believed to be
lost for centuries.

363
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,829
He devoted his life to scientific
research, but unfortunately...

364
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:34,319
Allah did not bless him
with the success he strived for.

365
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,889
I used to be a good friend of him,
and he asked me to give you this.

366
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:49,559
This is his personal diary
and research journal.

367
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,459
He told us that it contains
all his knowledge and findings.

368
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,679
However, we couldn't make any
sense of it.

369
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,659
Your father went a very long way
to make sure...

370
00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:02,169
that it would be handed over
to you personally...

371
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:05,199
and that it may never get
into the wrong hands.

372
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:10,189
And here it is. He titled it: "Finding
my Way to the Temple of Dunnowhat."

373
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:19,579
Indeed, this doesn't make any sense
to me either.

374
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:21,989
Is this book all he left me?

375
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:25,369
No, I have two more items for you.

376
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:29,909
Let me guess... A bucket of
sand and a shovel?

377
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,939
No. He left you two things that
were very dear to him.

378
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:37,379
You should cherish them.
He never left home without them.

379
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,029
A whip and a hat?

380
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:46,949
Thank you, Daddy.

381
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:07,829
Shh! Shh! No licenced music
in the halls of the museum!

382
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,939
Okaaaay...

383
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,349
What is this museum about, anyway?

384
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,909
The exhibits in this museum are the
forgotten songs of the old ages.

385
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,319
There was a time when music was
not produced by producers...

386
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,079
and consumed by consumers.

387
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:27,809
Music was in the heart of everyone.

388
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:30,799
People would come together and
sing and dance...

389
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,309
and share their songs.

390
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,919
Music was a part of our
everyday lives...

391
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:37,819
and there used to be songs
for every occasion.

392
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,569
Those must have been wonderful times.

393
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:44,889
Nowadays, songs have become
intellectual property...

394
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,479
turning open hearts into greedy minds.

395
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,079
And what has once been an
inspiration for everyone...

396
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,839
has now become a means to fill the
pockets of just a few.

397
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:59,719
This museum preserves what is left
of the songs of the old ages.

398
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:02,279
Oh! Oh, can we hear one of them?

399
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,889
Sure! Follow me.

400
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:21,919
What a beautiful melody.

401
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:25,029
I've never heard that melody before.

402
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:30,689
See? That's why we are
preserving them.

403
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,959
There is a wealth of old songs
that are very beautifiul...

404
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:36,629
but nobody knows about anymore
today.

405
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:37,869
Really?

406
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,829
And each of these boxes
holds one of the forgotten songs?

407
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:45,559
Oh, this is so exciting! I can't wait
to hear all of them!

408
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,079
What is inside this one?

409
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:50,199
No! No! Don't touch that one! No!

410
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,589
Do not open this box again!

411
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:04,289
This is our collection of
spare vocals.

412
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,669
We need them for
restauration purposes.

413
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:10,389
Sometimes we find songs
that are not in good shape...

414
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:12,889
and then we use these for replacement.

415
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,919
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

416
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,889
May I open this one?

417
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:22,279
Sure!

418
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:29,699
Ooooh!

419
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:33,069
Aaaah!

420
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,309
Hey, wait a minute!

421
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,069
That's just a box with a light in it.

422
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:42,069
Oh, my mistake!

423
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:49,219
Well, as you can see...

424
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:52,759
there is no way to make big money
with all this old stuff.

425
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,759
And exactly that is the reason...

426
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,399
why we are a thorn in the side...

427
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:58,759
of the international media
corporations.

428
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:01,129
We are under their strict supervision.

429
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,079
One wrong note and this place will
be swarming with their minions.

430
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,159
Poke!

431
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,929
Poke, please! Poke!

432
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,299
Are you crazy?

433
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,499
Look, they're watching us!

434
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,219
Oh no! They are coming!

435
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,669
This is the THX! Sound check!

436
00:27:36,699 --> 00:27:38,509
You are Dolby surrounded!

437
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:40,529
Open the door!

438
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:52,099
Ah, there you are!

439
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:56,139
You've got something
that belongs to us!

440
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,609
You've got the choice!

441
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,879
Hand over the diary or...

442
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:01,999
certain death!

443
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,729
You've got five seconds!

444
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,649
Uh, the diary?

445
00:28:06,699 --> 00:28:09,459
Uh, well here! Take it!
I don't need it.

446
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:10,649
No, no!

447
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:14,349
No! Don't you dare come any closer!

448
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:16,059
You shall not have it!

449
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:19,199
- But... but... Mika...
- No! No, Lionel!

450
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:20,809
You can't give it to them!

451
00:28:20,889 --> 00:28:23,389
We went all the way to Egypt
to get this book!

452
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:26,499
And five minutes later
the thought police turns up...

453
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:27,969
and wants to take it away?

454
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:30,019
Don't you smell anything fishy?

455
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,059
Alright! You've had your chance!

456
00:28:33,249 --> 00:28:35,179
Now, prepare to die!

457
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,249
Attack!

458
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,889
Take the diary and run!

459
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:42,689
I'll hold them back! Run! Run!

460
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:45,119
No Mika! Mika! It's not worth it!

461
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,059
Stop talking! Just run!

462
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,039
I've seen this coming... Follow me!

463
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,929
I know a secret way out of here!

464
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:49,369
Ah, there we are.

465
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:57,859
Finally!

466
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,929
We must have been walking for hours.

467
00:30:01,949 --> 00:30:04,639
I thought I would never see
the light of another day.

468
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:05,919
Uh, day?

469
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,929
You mean night, sweetie-pie.
It's full moon!

470
00:30:09,729 --> 00:30:11,769
Oh no! Full moon?

471
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:12,939
And... And look!

472
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:15,309
This is a graveyard!

473
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,099
Have you never heard the stories...

474
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,739
about what can happen
on a graveyard...

475
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:19,869
under a full moon?

476
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,939
There migt be vampires!

477
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:23,029
Werewolves!

478
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,709
Zombies!

479
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:26,369
Or other unthinkable creatures
creeping out of their graves...

480
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,959
just waiting for innocent victims
walking by!

481
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,679
Yeah! The full moon always
makes me horny, too.

482
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:37,209
Why is it that you innocent guys
always get the good stuff?

483
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:38,769
I wanna be a victim, too!

484
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:42,599
Lori! When will you finally grow up?

485
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:45,739
Vampires and Werewolves and all the
other unthinkable creatures...

486
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:47,799
are just a figment of your imagination.

487
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:49,299
They don't exist.

488
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:51,719
Just like Santa Claus
or the Easter Bunny.

489
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:54,619
What?

490
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:58,009
There is no Easter Bunny?

491
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:01,449
No Santa?

492
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:02,619
But then...

493
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:06,119
Who brings the presents
and hides the eggs?

494
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:11,759
Lori... you still believe in...

495
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:12,889
I don't know what to-

496
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,359
Ha! Haha! Got ya! Got ya!

497
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,049
Come on, admit it! Admit it!

498
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:29,539
You really thought I still believed
in Santa Claus, didn't you?

499
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:30,919
Didn't you?

500
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,629
Yeah, yeah. You really got me there.

501
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:34,559
I must admit...

502
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:37,019
I wouldn't have been surprised
if it had been true.

503
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:41,009
See? I'm more grown-up
than you think!

504
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:44,049
As Mika said, we are tough girls,
we can handle this.

505
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:45,059
Right, Mika?

506
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:48,489
Uh... Mika?

507
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,679
Mika?

508
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:53,199
Oh no! No, Mika is gone!

509
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,619
Where is she? Where is she?

510
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:57,589
She got eaten by the werevolves!

511
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:58,639
Lionel!

512
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,009
Do something!

513
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:03,199
She... she could be dead!

514
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:05,079
Or worse!

515
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:13,259
Ah, there you are.

516
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,369
Look! She's back from the dead!

517
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,709
The vampires have turned her into a zombie!

518
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:22,669
We're all gonna die!

519
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:25,999
Lori? What are you talking about?

520
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:28,289
I'm sorry it took me so long...

521
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:32,189
but I had to get the THX police guys
acquainted with the three tenors...

522
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:33,499
before I could join you.

523
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:37,319
Oh, I'm so glad you made it!

524
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,129
We were worried about you.

525
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,649
No need to worry.

526
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,699
Having the black belt in cat-fighting
must be good for something.

527
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:46,209
Thank you so much.

528
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:47,949
We wouldn't have made it
without your help.

529
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:49,219
Ah, don't mention it.

530
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,209
Are you sure she's not
a zombie or something?

531
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,309
Ah, come on! Get a grip!

532
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,239
Will you stop pushing me around?

533
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,059
Lori, calm down, please!

534
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,329
I am calm! I am perfectly calm!

535
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:06,239
Do you know how it feels to be the
youngest member of the party?

536
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,139
Always been picked on
and pushed around...

537
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:10,699
never taken seriously!

538
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:13,389
And nobody seems to care at all,
what I have to say...

539
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:13,899
Lori!

540
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,479
- when it comes to...
- Lori!

541
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:16,339
What?

542
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,919
Thank you, Poke!

543
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:28,219
Was about time!

544
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:36,769
I think, we'll be safe here for a while.

545
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,649
This graveyard is not known
to the common people.

546
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,739
Lionel? Do you still have the diary?

547
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:46,149
Because now I'm really curious
about your father's notes.

548
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:49,419
If there are so many people
trying so hard to get it...

549
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,659
and your father making such a
fuss about its secrecy...

550
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,579
it must be very very important.

551
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:56,519
Alright.

552
00:33:56,989 --> 00:34:00,499
Alright, then. I would suggest we go
through it together, line by line.

553
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,909
Okay.

554
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:06,879
So, it's titled:

555
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:09,519
"Finding my way to the
Temple of Dunnowhat."

556
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,999
Whatever the
"Temple of Dunnowhat" might be,

557
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,249
it seems to be a place of
utmost importance...

558
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,739
and this book is probably the
key to finding it.

559
00:34:17,939 --> 00:34:19,809
This is what it says
on the first page:

560
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:24,899
"The politician's daughter
was accused of drinking water."

561
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,559
"No tea or tomato juice.
You'll see no potato juice."

562
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:30,809
What?

563
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,069
Wait, wait... Let me continue reading.

564
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:46,529
"You can't get cherry soda,
because they got to fill that quota."

565
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,279
"And when ham and eggs need savor,
coffee ketchup gives them flavor."

566
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:54,499
This is total bullshit!

567
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:57,579
Then it goes on like this:

568
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:01,789
"This is the rock that rolls,
not moving too fast or too slow."

569
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,539
"This is the rock that rolls,
as soon as it hits you, you'll know."

570
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,469
That's even worse.

571
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:10,719
Yes, we were equally confused
when we got to that part.

572
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,619
Lori...

573
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:21,489
What's the matter?

574
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:28,889
Lori, forget it! If you refuse to calm
down, that muzzle will stay on!

575
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:31,809
Now stop whining and let us
do our work, okay?

576
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,189
Okay.

577
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:42,299
"All the happy saints go marching in."

578
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,259
"And if one of those saints steps out
of line, he'll have to start again."

579
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:50,569
I don't know what your Dad
has been smoking, but...

580
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:53,969
I want some of that shit.

581
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:03,669
"Jacobs golden ladder
gets slippery at the top."

582
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:09,069
"And many-a happy-go-lucky saint
has made that long long drop."

583
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,239
I really wonder what this is all about.

584
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:21,489
Lori...

585
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:29,549
This is really strange, here...

586
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:33,739
Lori, one last time, stay put!

587
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,899
There are no monsters, there are
no vampires,

588
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:38,719
werewolves or zombies. Okay?

589
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:40,669
And we have serious business
to do here.

590
00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:42,029
Do you understand?

591
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,679
Oh, I have no idea
what has gotten into her.

592
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,589
Maybe it's the full moon.

593
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,819
Nah, I bet nobody ever got
into her, anyway.

594
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,329
Okay, let's continue.

595
00:36:55,499 --> 00:37:00,269
"A giant vision in the distance,
chase that rainbow down."

596
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:06,919
"I hear a pound pound
pounding in my chest..."

597
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:09,849
"I hear a knock knock
knocking sound."

598
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:14,589
"Knock knock knocking
on heaven's door."

599
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:19,079
"The trees speak to me,
and I listen to them carefully."

600
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:21,729
"Whether standing still or
blowing in the wind,

601
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:23,269
I hear them singing."

602
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:26,919
"The trees speak, they whisper
a sweet melody."

603
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:29,399
"The keepers of more wisdom
than you and I."

604
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,879
"So listen to them carefully."

605
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,139
Alright.

606
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:35,329
Okay. We have read through the
first four pages.

607
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:36,479
And you know what?

608
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,569
I didn't understand a single word!

609
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:40,919
Lionel, are you sure your Dad...

610
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,999
still had his wits together?

611
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:44,909
I'm not so sure anymore.

612
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:48,579
Hey, guys? You noticed anything?

613
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,029
No, what do you mean?

614
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,159
Lori has stopped whining.

615
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,779
Hey, now that you mention it...

616
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:58,069
Oh, was about time!

617
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:01,009
Sooo...

618
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,299
You can be quiet after all.

619
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:07,029
See? It wasn't that hard, was it?

620
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:10,499
Come on, let me remove this.

621
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,109
Okay guys, we have no choice.

622
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,579
We'll have to go through it again.

623
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,539
Let's see if there's something
we've been missing.

624
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,269
There must be a meaning to this.

625
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:31,729
You know...

626
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,849
The reasons of my father might be
hard to understand, but...

627
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,669
I'm quite sure he wasn't crazy.

628
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:38,469
This must be some kind of code.

629
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:44,739
"The politician's daughter
was accused of drinking water."

630
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,649
Hey! Hey, I know that line!

631
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,539
- Really?
- What?

632
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:53,309
Yes, I tried to tell you guys,
but you wouldn't let me!

633
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:55,149
Okay...

634
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:57,329
Well...

635
00:38:57,529 --> 00:39:01,229
You know Lori, it does sound
vaguely familiar to me but...

636
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,199
I can't really remember
where I first heard it.

637
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:04,449
So, where is it from?

638
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:07,359
It's an old song done by
Frank Sinatra.

639
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:09,289
It's the "Coffee Song".

640
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:11,799
And it goes like this.

641
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:28,799
"Way down among Brazilians
coffee beans grow by the billions."

642
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:32,009
"So they've got to find
Those extra cups to fill."

643
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:36,249
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil"

644
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,989
"You can't get cherry soda
Cause they've got to fill that quota."

645
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:44,279
"And the way things are I bet
They never will."

646
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:48,269
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

647
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,579
"No tea or tomato juice."

648
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:56,539
"You'll see no potato juice."

649
00:39:57,399 --> 00:40:00,039
"And all the farmers in Africa say:"

650
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:01,529
"Hey! Hey! Hey!"

651
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:05,289
"The politicians daughter
Was accused of drinking water."

652
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:08,669
"And was fined a great big
Fifty Dollar bill."

653
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:12,829
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

654
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:16,859
"No tea or tomato juice."

655
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:20,909
"You'll see no tomato juice."

656
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:23,829
"And all the farmers in Africa say:"

657
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,919
"Hey! Hey! Hey!"

658
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:28,109
"And when their ham and
eggs need savor,"

659
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:30,169
"Coffee ketchup gives them flavor."

660
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:32,879
"Coffee pickles way outsell the dill."

661
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:37,099
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

662
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:45,149
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

663
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:46,979
"In Brazil!"

664
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,259
"In Brazil!"

665
00:40:49,629 --> 00:40:53,009
"They got an awful lot of
coffee in Brazil."

666
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,829
"In Brazil!"

667
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:56,949
"In Brazil!"

668
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:14,589
Brazil!

669
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:19,089
Brazil!

670
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:21,459
- Brazil!
- Brazil!

671
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,819
Lori! Brazil! That's it!

672
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:25,439
Oh, well done, Lori!

673
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,559
You solved the first part
of the puzzle!

674
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,549
- Ooookay.
- Did I?

675
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,649
So we have to go to Brazil.

676
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:36,279
But, Brazil is a big country.

677
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:38,969
We need to figure out
where exactly we need to go.

678
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:42,409
Does anybody know the names of the
most important cities in Brazil?

679
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,599
Sure! There are: Brazilia, São Paulo,

680
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,409
Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Natal,

681
00:41:48,419 --> 00:41:51,059
- Salvador, São Felix...
- Uh, stop, stop, stop!

682
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:52,679
What was the last one again?

683
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:53,989
São Felix?

684
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:57,899
São Felix loosely translates to,
"The Lucky Saint."

685
00:41:58,149 --> 00:41:59,909
Look at this line in the book:

686
00:42:00,139 --> 00:42:04,639
"And many a-happy-go-lucky saint
has made that long long drop."

687
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:09,409
Well, I must say... not bad!

688
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:11,859
So we need to go to São Felix
in Brazil!

689
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:14,439
Mmh... São Felix.

690
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:17,719
A nice old town at the edge
of the brazilian rainforest.

691
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,459
And what do the other lines mean?

692
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:24,989
"I hear a pound pound
pounding in my chest."

693
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:28,839
"This is the rock that rolls,
as soon as it hits you, you'll know."

694
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:32,539
"The trees speak to me,
so I listen to them carefully."

695
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:34,539
I don't have a clue Lori but...

696
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:36,249
we finally have a starting point.

697
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:39,139
I hope those lines will make
more sense once we get there.

698
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:43,879
Please accept the advice of an
experienced archaeologist.

699
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:45,829
Try to memorize those lines.

700
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,219
You might get separated
or lose the book.

701
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:52,659
So it's decided! We are going to
visit the brazilian rainforest!

702
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:56,159
Ah, Brazil!

703
00:42:56,209 --> 00:43:00,079
It is such a wonderful place of
ancient history and adventure.

704
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:02,029
I wish I could come with you.

705
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:03,409
Well...

706
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:05,749
If you want to... We can use
all help we can get!

707
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,389
Yes! Why don't you join us?

708
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:09,989
Oh, thanks for the offer!

709
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:11,759
But I really can't go with you.

710
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:13,699
I'm an old man myself...

711
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:17,269
and if I don't stay here and take
care of the museum, who will?

712
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:21,909
Yes, my little one, it's time
to say goodbye.

713
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,819
But before you leave,
I've got something for you.

714
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,379
Oh, what is it? What is it?

715
00:43:27,809 --> 00:43:30,019
Here! Please accept this flask...

716
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:32,669
of real arabian mocha
as my farewell gift.

717
00:43:35,919 --> 00:43:39,429
Thank you... very much...
uh... I...

718
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:43,029
Hey cool! I owe you one!
That's the good stuff!

719
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:47,389
Thank you Yussef! That's
very kind of you.

720
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:50,409
But we must go now.
To the brazilian rainforest!

721
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:52,399
But how do we get there?

722
00:43:52,879 --> 00:43:56,649
Just follow me! I know a secret
passage to the airport.

723
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,649
Why am I not surprised...

724
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:16,939
Something is happening!

725
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:18,869
I don't know what it is...

726
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:20,789
but I can feel it.

727
00:44:21,129 --> 00:44:24,289
My urge to break free is
stronger than ever before.

728
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:25,869
I'm feeling restless.

729
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:28,569
Pacing back and forth in my confinement...

730
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:30,189
like an animal in it's cage.

731
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:32,769
I wish I could see more clearly.

732
00:44:33,209 --> 00:44:35,749
It feels like someone is coming!

733
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:37,599
Could it be possible...

734
00:44:37,649 --> 00:44:39,949
that the key has not been lost but...

735
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:41,609
merely misplaced?

736
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:44,189
I can feel darkness, but...

737
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:45,889
there's also light.

738
00:44:46,439 --> 00:44:48,369
Are they coming to free me?

739
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,959
Or are they coming to kill me?

740
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:53,909
Let them come!

741
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:57,409
I may be old, but I'm not rusty.

742
00:44:57,959 --> 00:45:01,749
Be it songs of war,
or songs of love.

743
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:04,279
Just let me sing!

744
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:41,809
Poke?

745
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:43,049
Poke.

746
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:45,129
- Poke!
- What?

747
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:48,089
During the whole flight you've been
listening to the same song...

748
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:50,959
Over and over and over
and over again!

749
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:54,519
This is making me crazy!

750
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:59,199
I spent my last three bucks on the
licence to put it onto my playlist!

751
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:02,099
However, the licence to remove
it from the playlist would be...

752
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,289
another five bucks!

753
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:05,669
But I'm broke!

754
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,389
Alright, alright!

755
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:09,979
For the good of society!

756
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:11,959
Look into your pockets.

757
00:46:12,399 --> 00:46:14,369
Does anyone have any
spare change...

758
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:16,259
so we can make this stop?

759
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:24,009
Okay, here we go.

760
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:32,639
Hello, this is your pilot speaking.

761
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:36,069
We are now above the brazilian
rainforest near São Felix.

762
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:37,509
Get ready to jump!

763
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:40,249
I repeat:
Get ready to jump!

764
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:42,689
What?

765
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:46,499
Get ready to... jump?

766
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:50,069
Did you really believe
those straps were safety belts?

767
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:51,859
Well, in a way they are.

768
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,989
Don't you remember the line
from that book?

769
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:59,549
"And many-a happy-go-lucky saint
has made that long long drop."

770
00:47:00,099 --> 00:47:03,169
The management of Poke Arilines
wishes you a pleasant flight!

771
00:47:05,899 --> 00:47:08,239
Count to three and pull the cord!

772
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:09,329
One!

773
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:11,219
Two!

774
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,669
Three! Hehe!

775
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,309
Okay guys, are you ready?

776
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,489
Mika? Poke?

777
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:19,989
- Ready!
- Let's rock!

778
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:42,619
Oh, sweet!

779
00:47:46,259 --> 00:47:48,289
The one single hole...

780
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,869
in the ground of the entire
goddamn rainforest...

781
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:55,759
and I step into it at once!

782
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:59,679
Great... This is just great.

783
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:02,099
A new world record!

784
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,019
I chipped eight claws,
deranged my hairdo...

785
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:08,019
ripped my clothes apart and
dislocated one shoulder...

786
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,769
in less than ten seconds!

787
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:13,909
This is number two on the
top ten worst things...

788
00:48:13,899 --> 00:48:15,319
that have ever happened to me.

789
00:48:15,549 --> 00:48:16,939
Right after number one:

790
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:19,129
Being hit over the head
with a tomb stone!

791
00:48:20,979 --> 00:48:23,209
And can somebody please
cut off this thing?

792
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,139
I want to cry now...

793
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:32,669
But I'm just too fed up with all this!

794
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:38,779
Having been kicked out of a plane...

795
00:48:39,229 --> 00:48:41,709
crashing into the brazilian
rainforest...

796
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:43,679
and landing inside this dark cave...

797
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:45,549
that has obviously no other exit...

798
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:47,479
than the skylight I fell through,

799
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:49,539
which I can't reach from down here.

800
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:53,979
It can't possibly get any worse
than this.

801
00:48:58,439 --> 00:48:59,749
Uh oh...

802
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:08,119
Oh no! not this time! Not this time!

803
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,699
Stop!

804
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:24,769
This is so depressing...

805
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:32,209
Thousand years of waiting
for the next adventurers...

806
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,049
coming into my cave
to be crushed by me...

807
00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:38,819
And now they don't even run away
from me anymore.

808
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,269
This is so depressing.

809
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:46,889
You are not going to crush me?

810
00:49:47,429 --> 00:49:50,649
Oh, I can still do it if you want to.

811
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,339
Although...

812
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:54,999
It's not much fun if you
don't run away.

813
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:57,879
Hold still, I'll make it quick.

814
00:49:58,039 --> 00:49:59,629
Oh! No, no no nonono!

815
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:02,159
I just changed my mind,
thank you very much.

816
00:50:03,289 --> 00:50:04,529
What's your name?

817
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:06,409
Does it matter?

818
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:08,859
To me? Yes, it does.

819
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,869
I used to have a name...

820
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:13,909
but I'm too depressed to remember.

821
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,009
What makes you so depressed?

822
00:50:18,129 --> 00:50:21,879
Well, are you happy to be down here?

823
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:24,899
Uh, no. Why?

824
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:26,479
See what I mean?

825
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:29,589
They put me in this cave and told me,

826
00:50:29,709 --> 00:50:31,839
"Watch over this glowing stone!"

827
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:35,079
"If anyone wants to touch it,
crush them!"

828
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:37,279
They made me believe that it's...

829
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:39,369
an incredibly honorable task...

830
00:50:39,419 --> 00:50:42,219
and that I'll be richly rewarded
some day.

831
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:43,709
And then they said,

832
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:44,949
"Good bye!"...

833
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:47,319
and made the entrance
of the cave collapse.

834
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:50,849
I feel so stupid!

835
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,169
Have you never tried...

836
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:55,729
breaking through the barrier
of the cave entrance?

837
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,989
I tried that once.

838
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,259
The only thing that happened
was a loud "Crunch!"

839
00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:04,169
And when I regained my senses
I found out...

840
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:07,399
that several small parts had
crumbled off me.

841
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:08,939
Mh... Ouch!

842
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:10,849
That must have hurt badly.

843
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:12,119
It did hurt.

844
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:14,339
But it's not the worst thing.

845
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:16,819
Not? What happened?

846
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:20,659
Papa! Papa!

847
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:22,599
Papa, Papa!

848
00:51:22,899 --> 00:51:24,639
- Papa!
- Oh no...

849
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:27,309
Not again you...

850
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:38,589
"Papa is a rolling stone!"

851
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,619
"Crushing adventurers who
fall in his home."

852
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:46,009
"And when they die,"

853
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:50,609
"All that's left are broken bones."

854
00:51:58,879 --> 00:52:01,919
"It was the third of September."

855
00:52:03,209 --> 00:52:06,309
"This day I'll always remember."

856
00:52:08,779 --> 00:52:10,809
"'Cause that was the day."

857
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:14,519
"When I realized,"

858
00:52:17,249 --> 00:52:20,689
"I'll never have a chance to leave here."

859
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:25,179
"I'm dumb like a rock
still I try to break free."

860
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:28,329
"Children I'm depending on you,"

861
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:30,839
"To help me get out."

862
00:52:30,979 --> 00:52:33,799
"But no! Instead they keep singing:"

863
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,839
"Papa is a rolling stone!"

864
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:42,029
"Crushing adventurers who
fall in his home."

865
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:44,309
"And when they die,"

866
00:52:44,509 --> 00:52:48,469
"All that's left are broken bones."

867
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:53,469
"Papa is a rolling stone!"

868
00:52:55,209 --> 00:52:58,669
"Crushing adventurers who
fall in his home."

869
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,799
"And when they die,"

870
00:53:01,049 --> 00:53:05,229
"All that's left are broken bones."

871
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:26,049
See?

872
00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:28,609
This is the only song they know.

873
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:30,549
And they've been
singing it every day...

874
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:32,289
for thousands of years.

875
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,379
Man, I'm so depressed.

876
00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:37,629
I'm going to crush you now.

877
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:40,319
No! No, no no no,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

878
00:53:41,129 --> 00:53:44,099
You remind me of something
I read in a book!

879
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:50,379
"This is the rock that rolls,
not moving too fast or too slow."

880
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:54,729
"This is the rock that rolls,
as soon as it hits you, you'll know."

881
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:57,469
They wrote a book about me?

882
00:53:57,459 --> 00:53:58,109
Yes!

883
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:00,809
It's the journal of the
world renowned...

884
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:03,959
stonaeologist...

885
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:06,009
Dr. Christopher Scruffycat.

886
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:08,449
You know what? You're famous!

887
00:54:08,509 --> 00:54:10,249
That's where I know you from!

888
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:11,859
Oh, great!

889
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,499
So, now I'm famous.

890
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:18,439
But what good is that to me
if I can't even leave this place?

891
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:19,579
Thank you.

892
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:22,879
Now I'm even more depressed
than ever before.

893
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,079
But you can leave this place!

894
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:29,949
All you have to do is
slam through the barrier!

895
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:33,059
I already tried and I failed.

896
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,609
Hey, let me tell you something.

897
00:54:34,979 --> 00:54:38,029
Don't let your failures define
who you are!

898
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:40,909
You're only a failure if you
fail to try!

899
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:43,989
- But I tried!
- Then try again!

900
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:46,469
You're a strong piece of rock...

901
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:48,089
and you're made to roll!

902
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,089
Do you really think so?

903
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:53,579
Sure! I must know, I read the book!

904
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:55,839
You're the mightiest rock in the world!

905
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:58,459
Come on! Tell me you can do it!

906
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:00,719
Can I?

907
00:55:00,879 --> 00:55:03,279
Come on, I know you can do it!

908
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:04,739
Give me an "R"!

909
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:05,879
"R"?

910
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,809
Give me an "O"!

911
00:55:07,889 --> 00:55:10,019
- "O"!
- "Give me a "C"!

912
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:12,039
- "C"!
- Give me a "K"!

913
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,059
"K"!

914
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,799
Who are you?

915
00:55:14,829 --> 00:55:17,309
I am "The Rock"!

916
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:18,179
Yes!

917
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:20,609
And now you're going out there...

918
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,839
and show them!

919
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:24,139
- Yes!
- Nobody can stop you!

920
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,259
Go, go go!

921
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:29,289
- Let's roll!
- Yeah!

922
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:39,709
Yes! You made it! You're great!

923
00:55:39,709 --> 00:55:42,119
- Fantastic!
- Yeah!

924
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:46,059
The powers of positive thinking.

925
00:55:48,229 --> 00:55:49,729
There's some truth in the saying,

926
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:50,939
"Being dumb like a rock".

927
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:52,699
I'm free!

928
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:54,509
It's wonderful!

929
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:57,809
The flowers are blooming and
the birds are singing!

930
00:55:57,899 --> 00:56:00,029
And... and...

931
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:02,459
Oh, I landed on a slope!

932
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:06,269
Out of the way! I can't stop!

933
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:07,909
It's going down!

934
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:11,779
No, no! Not the tree!

935
00:56:12,029 --> 00:56:13,619
Incoming!

936
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:15,489
Sorry!

937
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:18,089
Oh no! Be careful, old lady!

938
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:19,369
Out of the way!

939
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:26,529
Oh no, no!
Not the guy with the fruit stand!

940
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:30,109
Vaffanculo! Puttano! Bastardo!
Pompino! Cabeza de mierda!

941
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:31,539
Melonas! Ananas! Bananas!

942
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:32,949
I'm sorry!

943
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:41,639
So this is the little glowing thing...

944
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,479
the rock was supposed to protect.

945
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:46,389
I wonder what it might be good for.

946
00:57:03,259 --> 00:57:05,329
And strange sounds it makes.

947
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:08,339
Better I take it with me.
You never know.

948
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,479
Oh look! Look!
She's taking the glowing stone!

949
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:13,699
We must crush her!

950
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:15,339
We must crush her!

951
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:20,529
I'll crush her!

952
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,589
One! Two! Three!

953
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,159
Pull the cord!

954
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:51,009
Nothing's happening!

955
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,289
No, Lionel! Pull it again!

956
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:56,509
It won't open! Help! Help!

957
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:05,039
Lionel?

958
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:06,679
Lionel!

959
00:58:06,729 --> 00:58:07,969
Can you hear me?

960
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:09,159
Can you hear me?

961
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,569
Oh, wake up, Lionel!

962
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:12,079
You must wake up!

963
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:13,819
Oh, Lionel! Please!

964
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:16,119
You must not die!

965
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:18,979
Not here, not now!

966
00:58:19,389 --> 00:58:20,979
Lionel!

967
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,709
Hello?

968
00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:30,049
Where am I?

969
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:32,439
Is anybody here?

970
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,689
Am I dead?

971
00:58:45,649 --> 00:58:48,529
Hello Lionel!

972
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:51,679
How do you like it down here?

973
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:53,439
Are you comfortable?

974
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:58,249
Because, now it's time
to think, Lionel.

975
00:58:58,889 --> 00:59:01,199
Why did you go to Egypt?

976
00:59:01,649 --> 00:59:05,269
Was it because you cared
about your father's wishes?

977
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:08,179
Or was it just because you hoped...

978
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:10,379
your heritage would
contain more...

979
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:12,959
than just a dusty book?

980
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:16,229
Were you hoping for money?

981
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:18,849
Gold? Treasures?

982
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,269
Would you have traveled
all the way...

983
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:23,879
if you had known
what your heritage was?

984
00:59:24,709 --> 00:59:26,229
Come on!

985
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,769
You can admit it, now that it's over.

986
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:33,349
Was it worth having one
of your best friends...

987
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:37,389
kicked out of an airplane
at five thousand feet?

988
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:41,029
Think, Lionel!

989
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:43,209
Think!

990
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:44,989
But...

991
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:47,839
But, I was... I was just...

992
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:50,559
Well... uh...

993
00:59:51,229 --> 00:59:53,339
Let me explain, please!

994
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:55,919
Lori!

995
00:59:57,229 --> 00:59:59,599
Lori, please! No!

996
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:03,589
Let me explain!

997
01:00:04,589 --> 01:00:05,969
Poke?

998
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,739
Woo-hoo! Lionel!

999
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:11,519
You da man!

1000
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:13,759
This crash through the trees!

1001
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:15,279
Mar-ve-lous!

1002
01:00:15,499 --> 01:00:17,769
Your father would have been
proud of you!

1003
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,809
If you had survived, that is.

1004
01:00:20,089 --> 01:00:21,359
Hey, come on!

1005
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:24,219
Now that it's over nothing
matters anymore.

1006
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:25,729
Let's get drunk!

1007
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:27,839
I'd like to bring out a toast...

1008
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:31,389
to the marvelous
Lionel Scruffycat.

1009
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:34,669
Getting himself killed while
foolishly attempting to make up...

1010
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:38,089
for the failures of a lifetime
in less than a week!

1011
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,249
Cheers!

1012
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:42,689
Poke, Poke! No! It's not true!

1013
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:44,019
No...

1014
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:46,959
At least... It's only partly true.

1015
01:00:47,379 --> 01:00:48,769
Poke...

1016
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:52,089
Why does nobody listen to me?

1017
01:00:55,329 --> 01:00:56,359
Dad?

1018
01:00:56,669 --> 01:00:59,159
Is that you? You're alive?

1019
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:02,759
You didn't care for the last
ten years...

1020
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:04,959
so why would you care now?

1021
01:01:05,189 --> 01:01:06,559
No... I...

1022
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:08,699
Please... Listen to me!

1023
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:10,549
We don't have much time.

1024
01:01:10,749 --> 01:01:13,149
You are my son. And for me...

1025
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:14,509
you have always been the most...

1026
01:01:14,509 --> 01:01:15,969
precious thing in the world.

1027
01:01:16,169 --> 01:01:19,199
Leaving you alone like this
was the hardest decision...

1028
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:20,799
I ever had to make.

1029
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:22,569
But things were at stake...

1030
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:23,969
that were so important...

1031
01:01:24,169 --> 01:01:27,109
not just for you, but for the
entire world...

1032
01:01:27,169 --> 01:01:29,109
that I had no other choice!

1033
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:31,559
Please, you must trust me!

1034
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,579
It saddens me to see that you have...

1035
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,859
stopped believing in me.

1036
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:36,379
But it's not too late!

1037
01:01:36,629 --> 01:01:38,609
You must fulfill my legacy...

1038
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:41,109
or otherwise the world
may be changed forever!

1039
01:01:41,259 --> 01:01:43,629
Trust me, Lionel, because...

1040
01:01:43,649 --> 01:01:44,859
I am your father.

1041
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:46,809
I'm proud of you, Lionel.

1042
01:01:46,899 --> 01:01:48,419
I always was.

1043
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:50,159
I love you.

1044
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:53,979
No, Dad Come back!

1045
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:55,259
Don't leave me!

1046
01:01:55,689 --> 01:01:57,159
Don't leave me again...

1047
01:01:57,579 --> 01:02:00,379
There's so much I need to tell you
which I never did...

1048
01:02:00,379 --> 01:02:01,619
even if I should have.

1049
01:02:01,859 --> 01:02:04,179
Dad... please...

1050
01:02:10,979 --> 01:02:13,019
Oh, Lionel!

1051
01:02:13,069 --> 01:02:16,609
Now you see where you got
yourself with logic!

1052
01:02:16,979 --> 01:02:19,999
If only once you had
followed your heart.

1053
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:22,499
Now you put not only yourself...

1054
01:02:22,649 --> 01:02:25,079
but all of your friends in danger!

1055
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:26,679
And why?

1056
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:28,969
Because, you're a coward!

1057
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:32,549
The only reason why you never
talked to your father was...

1058
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:35,979
because you were afraid to
confront yourself with him!

1059
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,199
What are you?

1060
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,379
A big, strong lion?

1061
01:02:40,709 --> 01:02:42,579
I will tell you what you are.

1062
01:02:42,689 --> 01:02:44,029
You're a sheep!

1063
01:02:44,129 --> 01:02:46,009
Baaaah! Lionel!

1064
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:47,989
I bet when you were at school...

1065
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:50,379
you were beaten up by the girls!

1066
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:56,009
Ouch!

1067
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:57,539
That hurt!

1068
01:02:57,659 --> 01:02:59,409
Oh now, come on!

1069
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,509
Do you dare hitting me back?

1070
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:04,279
Oh, come on!
You don't dare hitting me?

1071
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:08,189
Lionel is a coward!
Lionel is a coward!

1072
01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:09,449
Baaaah!

1073
01:03:11,049 --> 01:03:13,429
Mika, no! Stop hitting me, please!

1074
01:03:14,299 --> 01:03:17,479
You're just getting what
you deserve, Lionel!

1075
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:20,289
Sometimes the truth does hurt!

1076
01:03:20,389 --> 01:03:22,409
Oh, come on! Fight!

1077
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:23,589
Fight!

1078
01:03:23,609 --> 01:03:24,749
You coward!

1079
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:26,759
Finally learn how to fight!

1080
01:03:27,089 --> 01:03:29,859
Nobody messes with Mika!

1081
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:32,549
No, no, no! I don't want to!

1082
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,109
No, please! No! Ouch!

1083
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:38,529
No, no! Don't hit me, please!

1084
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:42,879
Lionel!

1085
01:03:43,189 --> 01:03:44,449
Lionel!

1086
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:46,059
Wake up!

1087
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:48,199
Please! Oh, come on, Lionel!

1088
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:49,789
You must not die!

1089
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,449
Lionel!

1090
01:03:52,879 --> 01:03:54,549
We've come this far!

1091
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:56,379
You can't leave me now!

1092
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,169
Don't leave me!

1093
01:04:00,259 --> 01:04:01,609
Oh no...

1094
01:04:01,999 --> 01:04:03,739
This can't be true!

1095
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:05,379
Oh, Lionel!

1096
01:04:05,669 --> 01:04:07,649
I can't live without you!

1097
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:10,659
And there's so much I wanted
to tell you, but...

1098
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:12,219
but I never dared.

1099
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:14,249
Oh, please!

1100
01:04:16,129 --> 01:04:17,899
I never had the chance to say...

1101
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:19,369
how much I love you!

1102
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:22,619
What am I going to do now?

1103
01:04:23,009 --> 01:04:24,999
Oh, this is so terrible!

1104
01:04:28,439 --> 01:04:29,929
- Ow!
- Lionel!

1105
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,919
Lionel! You're alive!

1106
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,239
Lionel!

1107
01:04:33,439 --> 01:04:36,309
No! don't hit me please!
Don't hit me!

1108
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:38,659
Are you alright?

1109
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:41,339
I thought I had lost you forever.

1110
01:04:43,469 --> 01:04:45,729
My head hurts like hell...

1111
01:04:45,729 --> 01:04:48,479
and I'm feeling kinda dizzy.

1112
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:54,449
Oh, I'm so glad you're alive!

1113
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:57,489
So am I.

1114
01:04:58,579 --> 01:04:59,789
What happened?

1115
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:01,719
Your parachute didn't open.

1116
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,749
But the tree stopped your fall.

1117
01:05:09,779 --> 01:05:11,599
I must have been really lucky.

1118
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,369
No broken bones, I think.

1119
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:17,019
Oh, Mika...

1120
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:20,749
Mika, I'm feeling so miserable about
how I treated my father.

1121
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:22,549
Oh, come on, Lionel.

1122
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:24,429
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1123
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,609
You are paying your filnal respect
to him after all.

1124
01:05:27,879 --> 01:05:29,879
And even risked your life for it.

1125
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:32,209
What more could a father ask for?

1126
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:35,039
No Mika, you don't understand.

1127
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:36,969
My father is dead...

1128
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:39,039
Nothing I do today can make up...

1129
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,309
for the things I didn't do...

1130
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:41,729
for the last ten years.

1131
01:05:42,429 --> 01:05:44,019
Don't you realize, Mika?

1132
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:48,279
I was the one only thinking
about himself all the time!

1133
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,299
Even coming here was just...

1134
01:05:50,299 --> 01:05:52,159
because of my curiosity.

1135
01:05:52,569 --> 01:05:55,639
And I even put me and my
best friends in danger!

1136
01:05:55,729 --> 01:05:56,969
Look at me!

1137
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,219
The same could have happened to you!

1138
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:00,239
Or Poke!

1139
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,559
Or has possibly happened to Lori!

1140
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,569
I don't even see them around here!

1141
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:07,819
Where are they?
They could be dead...

1142
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:10,209
and it's all my fault!

1143
01:06:10,229 --> 01:06:13,439
Hush... hush, Lionel. Shhh...

1144
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:18,729
Hush... Calm down. It's alright.

1145
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:20,749
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1146
01:06:21,129 --> 01:06:22,479
We're your friends!

1147
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,309
You didn't force us to come with you,
remember?

1148
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:28,429
Yes... you're right.

1149
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:30,509
There, there...

1150
01:06:31,259 --> 01:06:33,979
You're alive, and I am alive, too.

1151
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:37,299
And I am sure the others
are doing fine as well.

1152
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:39,469
Aww... Come on, don't cry.

1153
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:41,289
It's alright.

1154
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,059
Oh, Mika...

1155
01:06:43,069 --> 01:06:45,259
Mika, I'm so glad that you're here.

1156
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:47,289
And I am glad that you're here.

1157
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:50,049
Mika...

1158
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:51,619
What shall I do?

1159
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:53,749
What shall we do?

1160
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:56,759
We've crashed into the middle
of the jungle and...

1161
01:06:56,989 --> 01:06:58,849
Now I'm all confused.

1162
01:06:59,979 --> 01:07:03,409
Until now, I always thought I knew
what I should do...

1163
01:07:03,579 --> 01:07:05,789
but this time I don't have
any clue at all...

1164
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:08,099
I'm so clueless!

1165
01:07:09,489 --> 01:07:12,419
What - should - I - do?

1166
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:16,089
Stop hitting my trunk
with your head for a start.

1167
01:07:20,489 --> 01:07:21,759
Who's talking?

1168
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:24,439
The one who saved your life!

1169
01:07:26,149 --> 01:07:28,609
A talking tree?

1170
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:31,959
Excellent observation, Mr. Holmes.

1171
01:07:32,499 --> 01:07:36,239
And don't even think of thanking me
for saving your life...

1172
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:39,189
by sacrificing at least two branches...

1173
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:42,039
a dozen twigs and countless leaves.

1174
01:07:42,399 --> 01:07:45,049
This will take years to grow back.

1175
01:07:45,259 --> 01:07:47,349
A talking tree!

1176
01:07:47,369 --> 01:07:48,439
Lionel!

1177
01:07:48,489 --> 01:07:50,149
Remember the line from the book?

1178
01:07:50,439 --> 01:07:54,089
"The trees speak to me
so I listen to them carefully."

1179
01:07:57,169 --> 01:07:58,959
Then we must be on the right track!

1180
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:01,719
Hey, hey tree! Do you have a name?

1181
01:08:02,169 --> 01:08:03,809
And thanks for saving my life!

1182
01:08:04,469 --> 01:08:06,829
You can call me "Mr. Tree".

1183
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:10,629
And you're welcome.

1184
01:08:11,479 --> 01:08:14,129
Alright then - uh - Mr. Tree.

1185
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:16,689
It seems that we need
your help one more time.

1186
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,519
We are looking for something...

1187
01:08:18,579 --> 01:08:20,769
but we don't know exactly what it is.

1188
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:23,029
It might be a map, a hint,

1189
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:25,119
an artifact or something else.

1190
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:27,079
It was mentoioned in a  book...

1191
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:29,289
referring to a talking tree, like you.

1192
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:32,089
Do you know anything that
might be of help?

1193
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:35,279
Oh, yes. How do you know?

1194
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:39,659
In fact, I am the guardian of a
very mighty artifact.

1195
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:43,479
It was given to me more than
a thousand years ago.

1196
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,199
What is it?

1197
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,259
I can't tell you...

1198
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,289
unless you can prove...

1199
01:08:49,299 --> 01:08:52,099
that you're the ones destined
to receive it.

1200
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,589
And how are we supposed to do that?

1201
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:57,089
Well, if you are the ones...

1202
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:59,299
you are supposed to know.

1203
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:00,579
Shit!

1204
01:09:00,909 --> 01:09:02,599
That means we're stuck.

1205
01:09:03,629 --> 01:09:05,659
Lionel, do you still have the diary?

1206
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:09,709
No, I must have lost it...

1207
01:09:09,709 --> 01:09:11,629
crashing into our friend, Mr. Tree.

1208
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,069
Hey! I can't concentrate like this!

1209
01:09:16,129 --> 01:09:18,559
Will you the heck stop sawing!

1210
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:21,519
We're trying to hold a
conversation here!

1211
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,029
Hey you, are you crazy?

1212
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:32,509
What are you doing here?

1213
01:09:32,539 --> 01:09:34,919
I just wanted to ask you the same thing.

1214
01:09:34,989 --> 01:09:37,149
Can't you see?
I'm clearing the rain forest.

1215
01:09:37,529 --> 01:09:38,959
Clearing the...

1216
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:40,469
Chopping down trees, cutting wood,

1217
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:42,079
trimming the vegetation, you know?

1218
01:09:42,809 --> 01:09:45,389
And that one is next. Number "696".

1219
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:48,079
Come on, people, get out of the way.
This is dangerous.

1220
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:56,579
No, you can't do this! Stop! Please!

1221
01:09:56,979 --> 01:09:58,869
Put that thing down!

1222
01:10:00,549 --> 01:10:02,189
Alright, who sent you here?

1223
01:10:02,189 --> 01:10:04,359
Greenpeace? Robin Wood?
World Wildlife Fund?

1224
01:10:04,359 --> 01:10:06,219
United Tree-Huggers of
Oklahoma City?

1225
01:10:06,249 --> 01:10:08,049
The Concerned Parents
of Minnessota?

1226
01:10:08,099 --> 01:10:10,169
Huh? What are you talking about?

1227
01:10:10,209 --> 01:10:13,339
We're from the "Museum of
Forgotten Arts" in Cairo.

1228
01:10:14,429 --> 01:10:18,069
Can't you just cut down a different
tree than this one?

1229
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,049
Well, there are lots of trees in
the rain forest...

1230
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,869
Big ones, small ones,
old ones, young ones,

1231
01:10:21,869 --> 01:10:24,049
some have more leaves,
some have less leaves, so...

1232
01:10:24,109 --> 01:10:27,629
For the highest wood quality we have
to be a tad more specific, you know.

1233
01:10:30,599 --> 01:10:31,829
Ouch.

1234
01:10:32,469 --> 01:10:35,609
But you can't do that! He's our friend.

1235
01:10:36,519 --> 01:10:38,299
He saved my life!

1236
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:40,709
Uh... what the...

1237
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:43,059
Well, I've heard enough. Out of my way!

1238
01:10:44,759 --> 01:10:46,069
No!

1239
01:10:47,759 --> 01:10:48,669
No!

1240
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:51,719
No! You're not getting near this tree!

1241
01:10:53,089 --> 01:10:55,609
Mika, I've learned something.

1242
01:10:55,609 --> 01:10:58,489
There are times where logic
will not get you anywhere.

1243
01:10:58,579 --> 01:11:02,399
We can give this guy here as many
explanations as we want...

1244
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:04,319
he is not going to understand.

1245
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:07,169
Now listen, Panda!

1246
01:11:07,259 --> 01:11:08,779
You can't chop down this tree...

1247
01:11:08,779 --> 01:11:11,259
because I have to fulfill
my father's legacy.

1248
01:11:11,339 --> 01:11:14,679
I have denied my father long enough,
but I tell you...

1249
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:16,749
I, Lionel C. Scruffycat,

1250
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:19,299
am proud to be the son of
Christopher Scruffycat.

1251
01:11:19,389 --> 01:11:20,959
May he rest in peace!

1252
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:23,479
And I am defending this tree...

1253
01:11:23,569 --> 01:11:25,009
in the name of my father.

1254
01:11:25,029 --> 01:11:27,109
And if you want to take it down...

1255
01:11:27,109 --> 01:11:29,659
you will have to take me down first.

1256
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,439
What? You're the son of
Christopher Scruffycat?

1257
01:11:32,499 --> 01:11:35,239
The Christpoher Scruffycat?
The singer?

1258
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:36,539
You knew him?

1259
01:11:36,579 --> 01:11:37,969
Well, not in person, but...

1260
01:11:37,969 --> 01:11:39,899
when I was young, I was a huge fan.

1261
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:43,059
I still own all his CDs.
He's a childhood memory.

1262
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:45,689
I always wondered what happened
to him, after he quit.

1263
01:11:45,739 --> 01:11:48,229
Ah, okay... Okay then...

1264
01:11:48,259 --> 01:11:51,589
Listen... my father passed away
four days ago...

1265
01:11:51,609 --> 01:11:53,679
and I'm here to fulfill his last wish.

1266
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:56,569
I can't explain it to you, but...

1267
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,909
This tree here is part of it.

1268
01:11:58,969 --> 01:12:00,239
I can't let you kill it.

1269
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:01,519
Wow!

1270
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:04,529
You're going through all that trouble
just for your father's last will.

1271
01:12:04,559 --> 01:12:05,929
Pretty impressive.

1272
01:12:06,219 --> 01:12:09,379
You must have hell of a respect
for your father.

1273
01:12:11,709 --> 01:12:12,959
Ouch.

1274
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:15,829
Well... I do what I can.

1275
01:12:16,049 --> 01:12:18,269
You know, I'd really love
to spare this tree but...

1276
01:12:18,269 --> 01:12:20,539
I have to follow my orders,
or I lose my job.

1277
01:12:20,599 --> 01:12:24,139
Mh... wait... what number did this
tree have again?

1278
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,959
"696"?

1279
01:12:29,289 --> 01:12:31,059
Let's have a look.

1280
01:12:40,779 --> 01:12:43,649
Ok, look! This must be a mix-up!

1281
01:12:43,799 --> 01:12:45,909
This tree has the number "969".

1282
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:47,599
And "969" is not on my list.

1283
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:50,319
Silly me! I nearly cut down
the wrong tree!

1284
01:12:50,629 --> 01:12:52,779
Uh... you mean...

1285
01:12:52,879 --> 01:12:55,569
Oh, I see! Thank you!

1286
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,639
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

1287
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,829
Have a nice day!

1288
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:14,109
Phew!

1289
01:13:14,509 --> 01:13:16,609
That was close!

1290
01:13:16,899 --> 01:13:18,559
Yes, it was!

1291
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:23,859
Okay, this time you saved my life.

1292
01:13:24,219 --> 01:13:25,519
Thank you!

1293
01:13:25,919 --> 01:13:27,989
Now I really owe you one.

1294
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,309
What can I do for you?

1295
01:13:30,389 --> 01:13:34,489
Well, you said, you were guarding
a certain artifact...

1296
01:13:34,879 --> 01:13:36,339
Alright!

1297
01:13:36,419 --> 01:13:37,809
You shall have it!

1298
01:13:37,939 --> 01:13:39,979
Nobody wanted it for ages...

1299
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:42,449
So why shouldn't I give it to you.

1300
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,629
What on earth is that?

1301
01:14:02,839 --> 01:14:04,999
It's a secret artifact.

1302
01:14:06,169 --> 01:14:07,599
The thing about secrets is...

1303
01:14:07,599 --> 01:14:09,949
that nobody's supposed
to know about them.

1304
01:14:12,049 --> 01:14:15,739
It was handed to me by some
sort of high priest...

1305
01:14:15,919 --> 01:14:18,509
And he simply didn't tell me
what it is.

1306
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,359
So I can't tell you.

1307
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:21,779
I'm sorry.

1308
01:14:22,009 --> 01:14:24,019
We will find out eventually.

1309
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,289
But, first we'll have to find
the rest of our party.

1310
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:29,459
I bid you farewell, then!

1311
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:32,219
And thank you again for
saving my life.

1312
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:34,479
I consider you good friends.

1313
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:37,649
I hope you will return some day.

1314
01:14:37,879 --> 01:14:39,289
Goodbye, Mr. Tree!

1315
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:40,579
Goodbye!

1316
01:14:40,829 --> 01:14:42,699
Come on, Mika. Let's go.

1317
01:14:56,779 --> 01:14:59,049
United Pawcel Service!

1318
01:14:59,319 --> 01:15:04,499
Package for "Tree, Mr. 696"?

1319
01:15:09,669 --> 01:15:11,419
Hey, hey!

1320
01:15:11,429 --> 01:15:13,229
That's for me!

1321
01:15:13,499 --> 01:15:15,739
Uh, wait! Uh...

1322
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:33,299
- Lori?
- Lori?

1323
01:15:33,799 --> 01:15:35,849
Lori!

1324
01:15:36,469 --> 01:15:37,809
Lori!

1325
01:15:38,349 --> 01:15:41,579
- Lori! Where are you?
- Lori?

1326
01:15:45,819 --> 01:15:47,569
Lori!

1327
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:50,399
- Lori?
- Lori!

1328
01:15:51,299 --> 01:15:52,249
Lori!

1329
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:57,049
Lionel? Mika!

1330
01:15:57,649 --> 01:16:00,329
Lionel! Where are you?

1331
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:03,169
Lionel? Mika!

1332
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,419
Lori?

1333
01:16:06,559 --> 01:16:07,909
Lori?

1334
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:11,869
Aaah! Lionel!

1335
01:16:11,879 --> 01:16:14,729
Woman! Woman! Woman! Woman!

1336
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:15,729
Mika?

1337
01:16:15,759 --> 01:16:17,469
Mika!

1338
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:21,989
Lionel?

1339
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:24,189
Mika!

1340
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:25,999
Lionel!

1341
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:28,179
Lori?

1342
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:29,979
- Lionel?
- Lori!

1343
01:16:30,029 --> 01:16:31,699
- Lionel!
- Lori!

1344
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:33,929
- Lionel!
- Lori!

1345
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:36,039
Lionel?

1346
01:16:36,109 --> 01:16:38,209
- Mika?
- Lionel!

1347
01:16:38,859 --> 01:16:39,959
Mika!

1348
01:16:39,979 --> 01:16:41,909
- Lori!
- Mika!

1349
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:47,809
Poke?

1350
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:54,419
I'm iup here! Here! In the tree!

1351
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,279
Poke!

1352
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:02,369
What are you doing up there?

1353
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:05,129
Wow! Outdoor tree bondage!

1354
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:15,479
Kinky!

1355
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:19,349
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

1356
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:20,999
I've been fucking hanging in this...

1357
01:17:20,999 --> 01:17:23,199
fucking tree for three fucking hours!

1358
01:17:23,309 --> 01:17:25,019
And it's fucking beginning to get...

1359
01:17:25,019 --> 01:17:26,409
on my fucking nerves!

1360
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:31,939
I can see you balls!

1361
01:17:37,259 --> 01:17:38,489
Fuck!

1362
01:17:38,519 --> 01:17:40,949
Will you fucking morons get me the
fuck out of this fucking tree...

1363
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:42,969
so I can cone down and kick
your fucking asses?

1364
01:17:45,519 --> 01:17:47,049
I'd sure like to!

1365
01:17:47,069 --> 01:17:49,209
But how are we supposed
to do that, huh?

1366
01:17:49,219 --> 01:17:51,829
I don't care, just get me down!

1367
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:57,189
Alright .. alright.
We've got to make a plan.

1368
01:17:57,179 --> 01:17:58,629
How do we get him down?

1369
01:17:58,969 --> 01:18:01,269
Preferably without getting
our asses kicked...

1370
01:18:01,269 --> 01:18:02,619
got that, Poke?

1371
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:06,279
Can't we just leave him up there?

1372
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:10,259
My day has been bad enough already.

1373
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:11,599
No,

1374
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:13,379
Okay...

1375
01:18:13,849 --> 01:18:17,179
How about... throwing coconuts at him
until he falls down?

1376
01:18:18,649 --> 01:18:19,839
No way!

1377
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:24,219
Okay, then... We could rig this
tree with dynamite and...

1378
01:18:24,219 --> 01:18:25,379
Boom!

1379
01:18:25,429 --> 01:18:26,929
Instant untangling!

1380
01:18:26,929 --> 01:18:28,249
- No!
- No!

1381
01:18:29,339 --> 01:18:30,309
Oh well...

1382
01:18:30,309 --> 01:18:31,919
If you don't like my suggestions...

1383
01:18:31,919 --> 01:18:33,409
I can just as well shut up.

1384
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:35,489
Who is going to listen to me anyway?

1385
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:48,379
Lori, don't start it again!

1386
01:18:48,389 --> 01:18:50,429
I'm completely finished with my nerves,

1387
01:18:50,419 --> 01:18:53,179
and this is the last thing I need now.

1388
01:18:53,539 --> 01:18:55,099
- We really should-
- Shh!

1389
01:18:55,799 --> 01:18:57,249
Did you hear something?

1390
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,399
I think, someone's coming!

1391
01:19:01,259 --> 01:19:03,329
Aah, that was a good one!

1392
01:19:08,989 --> 01:19:11,539
Okay, it was just Poke.

1393
01:19:11,559 --> 01:19:13,009
Where were we?

1394
01:19:13,099 --> 01:19:15,749
Well, this completely threw me off.

1395
01:19:15,849 --> 01:19:17,629
I think, I was about to say-

1396
01:19:17,639 --> 01:19:18,489
Freeze!

1397
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:20,469
This is the THX!

1398
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:31,729
Ah, look who we have here!

1399
01:19:31,949 --> 01:19:34,389
You are under arrest!

1400
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,829
Don't even think of moving...

1401
01:19:36,919 --> 01:19:38,619
or else...

1402
01:19:39,979 --> 01:19:44,239
This is really annoying,
Mr. Lionel Scruffycat.

1403
01:19:44,839 --> 01:19:48,919
No matter what we try, you just
refuse to die.

1404
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:51,749
I have no idea how you made it.

1405
01:19:51,879 --> 01:19:55,249
Your parachute was never
supposed to open.

1406
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,039
Well, indeed. It didn't.

1407
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:02,059
You seem to be a really tough guy.

1408
01:20:02,269 --> 01:20:05,369
But that will be no longer
of help to you.

1409
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:07,879
Because now you're coming with us!

1410
01:20:08,109 --> 01:20:11,219
Oh you! You tried to kill Lionel?

1411
01:20:11,299 --> 01:20:12,799
You bastards!

1412
01:20:13,149 --> 01:20:15,789
Come here!
I'll slit your chests open...

1413
01:20:15,789 --> 01:20:17,049
and drink your blood...

1414
01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:18,599
while your hearts are still beating!

1415
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:21,329
I'll kill you! I will kill you!

1416
01:20:27,469 --> 01:20:31,329
Ah, felines are so easy to overcome.

1417
01:20:31,779 --> 01:20:34,679
Just grab them by the
scruff of their neck...

1418
01:20:34,759 --> 01:20:38,349
and their carrying reflexes
will kick in.

1419
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:42,109
Now, isn't she cute?

1420
01:20:42,119 --> 01:20:43,809
Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!

1421
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:47,529
How on earth did you
manage to follow us...

1422
01:20:47,529 --> 01:20:50,439
without a copy of the diary?

1423
01:20:50,549 --> 01:20:52,729
Well, that's easy.

1424
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:56,929
It's true, you did have the only
copy of that book, but...

1425
01:20:56,929 --> 01:20:59,739
here is a little hint for your
next adventure.

1426
01:20:59,869 --> 01:21:02,289
If you browse through
secret documents...

1427
01:21:02,339 --> 01:21:04,109
You should rather not do that...

1428
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,339
directly underneath a surveillance cam.

1429
01:21:06,759 --> 01:21:08,089
D'oh!

1430
01:21:09,969 --> 01:21:11,729
Okay, enough talking!

1431
01:21:11,729 --> 01:21:14,909
Ladies and Gentlemen,
your vacation ends here.

1432
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:17,929
I don't know what the
producer has in mind for you...

1433
01:21:17,929 --> 01:21:20,119
but it sure won't be pretty.

1434
01:21:20,429 --> 01:21:21,639
Now go.

1435
01:21:22,029 --> 01:21:23,839
I said, "Go"!

1436
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:28,169
You can't do that! I'm American!

1437
01:21:28,309 --> 01:21:29,609
Shut up!

1438
01:21:30,139 --> 01:21:31,339
Go!

1439
01:21:44,769 --> 01:22:12,189
The journey continues
on disk 2.
