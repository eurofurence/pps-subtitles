0
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,680
Long before our time,

1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,540
the Earth was ruled by humans.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,580
They could fly to the moon and lived in cities the size of kingdoms.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,640
But for all their great achievements,

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,540
they also built the most terrible weapons.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,380
When the Great War broke out,

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,540
it wiped their civilization from the face of the Earth in

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,540
a matter of days,

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,520
and only a few survived in shelters deep underground.

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,580
Unable to return to the surface,

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,600
the humans decided to create a new kind of creature to rebuild the world they had destroyed.

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,120
These creatures were just enough of a human to understand their master's commands,

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,120
but also enough of an animal to be denied their freedom.

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,480
The humans discovered

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,740
much too late that they had not created an army of willing slaves,

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,060
but rather a new people whose intelligence,

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,840
curiosity, and desire to live free was just as strong as their own.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,000
The revolution was swift and cruel,

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,460
and this time,

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,520
no humans survived.

20
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,840
The leaders of the uprising called themselves Keepers of the Light,

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,360
and their mastery of

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,080
human technology gave them godlike powers.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,400
The common folks worshipped them like saints

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,180
and simply accepted them as their new rulers,

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,140
for this was all they knew.

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,060
Generations passed,

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,340
and the memories of the uprising faded into legend,

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,380
and from legend into myth.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,060
Common folks as well as people among their own ranks became increasingly wary,

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,120
until,

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,080
in the year 385,

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,020
a terrible bloodbath finally ended the Keepers' reign.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,280
It was us,

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,520
the rebel underground,

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,100
who finally put an end to the Keepers' tyranny,

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,920
and ever since it has been our mission to give the Keepers' legacy of human knowledge back to whom it belongs.

37
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,180
You,

38
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,540
the true descendants of humankind.

39
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,280
This is why you are here,

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,400
at the Institute of Science, History, and Morality,

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,600
and I would like to wholeheartedly welcome all of our new students who have joined us today here in Ferndale for the beginning of the new semester.

42
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,260
Same old speech.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:31,980
Yeah,

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,880
I've heard the professor say this so many times I can almost repeat it word for word.

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,480
Well,

46
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,820
if you two already know it so well,

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,880
I'm sure you know what this symbol here on the wall means.

48
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,660
It's the tree of knowledge,

49
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,580
and it means, well, it's a tree and it grows,

50
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,880
just like knowledge.

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,120
It used to be the secret symbol of the rebel underground,

52
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,720
but it stands for more than just knowledge.

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,380
It also stands for the ideals of a new society,

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,420
peace, progress, and freedom.

55
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,460
And who were the heroes who gave their lives for that freedom, huh?

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,500
You over there.

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,580
Um,

58
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,060
let me think.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,840
I

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,040
think it was Black something and the other guy.

61
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,540
See?

62
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,500
That's what you get for talking all the time.

63
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,500
Does anybody else know?

64
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,780
Rain Dancer,

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,860
how about you?

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,240
Why always me?

67
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,260
Okay.

68
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,820
The three great dead people of the Rebellion.

69
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,300
Brother Fireheart of Cold Lake,

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,120
founding father of the Rebellion,

71
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,380
executed by the Keepers of the Light.

72
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,560
Stormrunner of Camp Freedom,

73
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,940
who died in the heroic fight over the Holy Mountain.

74
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,460
And Riversong of Ferndale,

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,680
who infiltrated the Keepers' stronghold all on his own,

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,600
sacrificing himself to end the Keepers' reign.

77
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,060
He will always be remembered.

78
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,440
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,860
Come on, Rain Dancer.

80
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,340
Riversong was your father.

81
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,820
You should be proud of your family history.

82
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,880
Well, so what?

83
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,960
I've never met him.

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:13,880
Besides,

85
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,160
he's not the only one who died in the Rebellion, you know.

86
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,500
The Keepers burned down an entire Camp Freedom.

87
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,640
Aren't those people heroes too?

88
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,500
Maybe you should mention that it was Stormrunner,

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,480
the great Rebel leader's fault,

90
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,100
and that he was...

91
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Thank you, Rain Dancer.

92
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,840
I think that's enough.

93
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,820
We don't want to confuse our newcomers on their first day, do we?

94
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,220
Okay.

95
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,340
In short,

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,900
the Keepers are gone,

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,380
a lot of people died,

98
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,800
and the fatherless children who remained are now very proud.

99
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,400
Applause!

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,120
Close the curtain.

101
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,400
There he goes again.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,260
What?

103
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm so sick of talking about dead people all day.

104
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,020
I want to learn about physics and math and biology and the things that really matter.

105
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,160
Oh, you're such a nerd.

106
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,700
What?

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,180
No! No, no, no!

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,660
If you're not here to learn,

109
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,100
why don't you go the fuck home?

110
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,440
Silence! Silence! This is a university,

111
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,720
not a kindergarten! I said silence!

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Oh,

113
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,920
excuse me.

114
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,580
Is this the class of Professor Bottlebrush?

115
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,860
Huh?

116
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,040
Hello?

117
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,780
Did I miss something?

118
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,540
What the hell is that?

119
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,440
Is that what I think it is?

120
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,320
Oh,

121
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,340
you must be Winstar's foster child.

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
Yep, that's me.

123
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,580
I'm sorry for bursting in.

124
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,720
I really wanted to be on time,

125
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,140
but I'm new here,

126
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,160
and well, you know how it goes.

127
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,580
And I...

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,740
Hey, why are you all staring at me?

129
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,000
Have you never seen a pig before?

130
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,600
You'll have to excuse them, dear.

131
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,860
Pigs are not very common around here.

132
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,920
Actually, she's not a pig.

133
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,360
She's a Red River Hawk, right?

134
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,060
Very good,

135
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,780
Rain Dancer.

136
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,100
Yes, she is a Red River Hawk,

137
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,820
and her name is Potami.

138
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,080
Class, say hello to Potami.

139
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,240
Hello,

140
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,420
Potami.

141
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,560
Hello, everyone.

142
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,060
Welcome to our class,

143
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,480
Potami.

144
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,100
Feel free to pick a seat.

145
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,100
Thank you.

146
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,740
I

147
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,120
hope you don't mind if I hog the space.

148
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,880
No, of course not.

149
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,500
Why should I?

150
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,440
Oh,

151
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:58,940
well,

152
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,180
class, it seems like it's time for a break.

153
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,560
The class will resume at half past twelve.

154
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,140
See you then, and please, try not to kill each other in the meantime, all right?

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,400
Fine.

156
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,300
Welcome to the Dead Hero Society.

157
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,100
What was your name again?

158
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Potami, was it?

159
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,280
Yeah,

160
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,620
and hi.

161
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,340
What was your name?

162
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,560
I'm Rain Dancer.

163
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,920
It's nice to meet you, Rain Dancer.

164
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,120
So, you really don't mind sitting next to a pig?

165
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,820
No, no, why?

166
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,960
Well, is it just me,

167
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,760
or are the people in this village a little bit narrow-minded?

168
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,240
Yeah, this place is pretty backwards sometimes.

169
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,460
I've been living here all my life,

170
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,820
and people still think I am a weirdo.

171
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,660
Well,

172
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,100
people still think that I am a pig.

173
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,180
So,

174
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,180
if you're not a weirdo,

175
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,300
what are you?

176
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,480
Oh, a bit of this,

177
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,340
a bit of that.

178
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,440
A bit of fox,

179
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,540
and a bit of...

180
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,760
cat?

181
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:04,760
Yeah,

182
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,040
must have been some wild party.

183
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,220
So, and you've lived here all your life?

184
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,440
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

185
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,320
I really want to go to Ironforge when I'm ready for it,

186
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,860
but Uncle Brushy says I have to finish school first.

187
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,080
Professor Bottlebrush is your uncle?

188
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:26,720
Yeah,

189
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,680
well, not really, but that's kind of a long story.

190
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,480
Another one of those wild parties?

191
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,240
No, no, no, not like that.

192
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,460
Not like that.

193
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,200
Freeze!

194
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,960
Don't you dare make a sound,

195
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,860
or I'll put an arrow right between your eyes before you can even scream.

196
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,420
My,

197
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,240
my, what quick learners you are,

198
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,540
and so obedient too.

199
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,900
You all get an A plus from me.

200
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,520
Now, students, I'm afraid there has been a bit of a change in today's lesson plan.

201
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,840
It's time for all of you to go on a nice long field trip with us.

202
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,820
I promise the experience will be

203
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,180
educational.

204
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,780
This way,

205
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,880
we go out the back window.

206
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,540
Come on, move it,

207
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,920
and not a sound.

208
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,280
Who are you?

209
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,880
Where are you taking us?

210
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,420
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

211
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,300
Now shut up and move!

212
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,900
Welcome back, students.

213
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,660
Break is over and it's time

214
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
to...

215
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,600
Where

216
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,840
is everyone?

217
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,240
This better not be another of your silly pranks.

218
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,600
Hey, this isn't funny.

219
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,180
Come out!

220
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,660
What's this?

221
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,080
A note?

222
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,920
Oh, shit!

223
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,980
Open your eyes and here you'll see it all

224
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,480
Where shattered shadows always call

225
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,660
Raise up your ears and now you'll hear my will

226
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,880
Righteous thunder,

227
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,680
light-filled wonder Let their aura still

228
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,700
Give them my path,

229
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,620
I'll go through them Hold deep my hand, guide me right

230
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,880
Open eyes so they can see their last light

231
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:57,780
Leave me untouched and you'll have lost control

232
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,640
Let's make our power become whole

233
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,920
With but a flash,

234
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
they'll barely hear their fate

235
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:20,640
Swords and sticks will hold no tricks They're already too late

236
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,980
Give them my path,

237
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,520
I'll go through them Hold deep my hand,

238
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,800
guide me right Golden eyes so they can see their last

239
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,220
light

240
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,220
Faster than sound, I'll undo them With power I'll pull your divine

241
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,780
Golden eyes, you'll be forever mine

242
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,220
Give them my path,

243
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,240
I'll go through them Hold deep my hand, guide me right

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,940
Golden eyes so they can see their last light

245
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:57,520
Faster than sound, I'll undo them With power I'll pull your divine

246
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,680
Golden eyes, you'll be forever, ever, ever

247
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,820
Mine

248
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,040
Golden eyes

249
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,760
Yeah

250
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:29,320
Natty?

251
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,760
Natty! Hey, moron!

252
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,080
Oh, Nettlebosh! Wake up and stay awake, stupid!

253
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,720
Someone needs to watch over the hostages!

254
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,960
Yeah,

255
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,040
yeah.

256
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,700
Don't worry,

257
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,600
I've got everything under control.

258
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,520
The breads are all tied up,

259
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,000
no one's going anywhere!

260
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,780
I should hope so! If we lose them,

261
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,400
they're gonna cut off your ears!

262
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,660
All in the name of the opposition!

263
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,200
What do you think they're gonna do with them anyway?

264
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,340
Don't know,

265
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,900
don't care.

266
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,060
I'm not in it for the politics,

267
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,280
just the money.

268
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,580
The Institute, the opposition,

269
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,940
all them fucking keepers of the light.

270
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,540
Whoever wants to pay us,

271
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,160
no questions asked.

272
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,720
You think, you think they're gonna kill him?

273
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,940
Nah,

274
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
then we wouldn't be hauling them through them fucking forests here.

275
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,840
Right,

276
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,080
right.

277
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,040
Um,

278
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,200
say,

279
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,680
Ivy?

280
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,200
Oh, what?

281
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,920
Would you mind pulling over?

282
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,000
Why?

283
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,180
I, uh,

284
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,140
I gotta pee.

285
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,020
What?

286
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,240
Are you fucking serious?

287
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,900
Oh, for the love of- No!

288
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,980
They said we mustn't stop no matter what happens,

289
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,480
so you better hold it in!

290
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,540
But I really have to go!

291
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,040
Look,

292
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,820
we don't know if there's anyone following us,

293
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,480
and I don't want to be the one who finds out.

294
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,940
You should have gone before the raid!

295
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,480
I did go before! Come on,

296
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,440
we've been racing full speed for hours and I always have to go when I'm nervous!

297
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,220
Just get your shit together!

298
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,560
I'm trying! Try harder!

299
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,500
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

300
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,920
I've gotta do what a man's gotta do!

301
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Seriously?

302
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,040
You're seriously going to pee off the side of a moving fucking wagon?

303
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,540
What do you want me to do?

304
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,700
Wipe my pants?

305
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,220
No, let me do my business!

306
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,540
I don't fucking believe this!

307
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,000
That left...

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,420
that thing tastes like my mother's old socks!

309
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,020
Hey, Rainancer,

310
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,340
turn around so I can chew through your ropes quick!

311
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,140
Are you done yet?

312
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,000
Sit down, man!

313
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,040
Hey! I can't pee if you're watching me!

314
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,660
This is my fault now! You were the one that decided to stand right there to piss!

315
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,080
Well, you were the one who wanted to stop the wagon!

316
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,140
Ugh...

317
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,540
You're free!

318
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,380
Wow,

319
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,240
thanks.

320
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,620
You've got some sharp teeth.

321
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,200
Yeah, I hate being hogtied.

322
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,900
So,

323
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,900
should I ask you why you know how your mom's socks taste?

324
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,460
No,

325
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,000
you should untie my paws!

326
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,640
Oh, right, yeah.

327
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,460
Quick, before that moron comes back!

328
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,600
By the holy monk, that's disgusting!

329
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,360
Try not to hit the canopy, you idiot!

330
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,840
Watch the bloody roads!

331
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,720
Oops, was that a bottle?

332
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,560
Oh, my bad!

333
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,140
Oh, look,

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,060
there is another one!

335
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,740
And...

336
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,580
another one!

337
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,220
Phew, there were so many in this road all of a sudden!

338
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,740
I'm gonna kill you! I swear! As soon as we're back in Ironforge,

339
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm gonna kill you!

340
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,280
God...

341
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,380
Yes, thank you.

342
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,560
Rainancer,

343
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,480
quick, where did they put my bag?

344
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,500
We need to free the others!

345
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,580
Yeah, but I need my bag! This is important!

346
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,900
Okay...

347
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,020
Oh, gosh, there it is!

348
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,280
Got it!

349
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
Alright!

350
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,440
I feel so much better!

351
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,220
No thanks to you and your driving!

352
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:31,440
Congrats, you fucking lations! Achievement unlocked! Now get your bloody arse back there and do your fucking job!

353
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,620
Yeah, yeah...

354
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,320
Oh, quick, quick, quick! It's returning!

355
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,360
Oh, shit! We are out of time!

356
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,040
What?

357
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,320
We need to free the others!

358
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,220
We have to jump! No, no!

359
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:43,980
Yes!

360
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,560
I said jump! Now time!

361
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,320
Oi!

362
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,880
Oi, stop it! Oink, oink, motherfucker!

363
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,440
Stop

364
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,680
the wagon! Stop the fucking wagon!

365
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,560
What the fuck is going on back there?

366
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,280
Two of the damn Brats just jumped ship! We gotta go after them!

367
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,440
No fucking way! It's the Darkwoods, remember?

368
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,720
They don't have a light!

369
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,000
Those two aren't going to get far before the beasts will make a quick snack of them!

370
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,780
The nights out here are dark and full of terrors!

371
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,180
It wasn't my fault! I swear!

372
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,700
Of course it's your fault! If you had been watching,

373
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
then they wouldn't have gotten free!

374
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,120
No fucking way! I'm gonna waste more precious time!

375
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Just cause you're just literally too stupid to piss!

376
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,980
But, but, but, but, but...

377
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,480
No buts! We're already running late! And we still have plenty of Brats left!

378
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,260
Now go and check on the rest! We don't want to lose another one!

379
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,460
And if they do cut our pay,

380
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,700
it's coming out of your share!

381
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,160
Okay...

382
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,540
Okay...

383
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,600
Fucktards!

384
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,000
Damn idiots!

385
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,080
The

386
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,540
privilege of opening the first trial for the crimes committed by the Keepers of the Light imposes a grave responsibility.

387
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:28,080
The wrongs which we seek to punish have been so calculated and so malignant that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored,

388
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,520
because it cannot survive their being repeated.

389
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:40,720
The defendants in this case represent sinister influences that will lurk in the world long after their bodies have returned to dust.

390
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,200
We will show them to be living symbols of hatred,

391
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,220
terrorism,

392
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,500
and violence,

393
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,480
and of the arrogance and cruelty of Power.

394
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,460
It would have been easy to treat them in the same way like they treated their own adversaries,

395
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,700
but these trials shall be the most significant tribute that Power has ever paid to reason.

396
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,100
The accused will be given a fair opportunity to defend themselves,

397
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,700
a favor which the Order of the Keepers rarely extended to their enemies.

398
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,660
Despite the fact that public opinion already condemns their acts,

399
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,840
they must be given a presumption of innocence.

400
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,860
I now call the defendant to the witness stand.

401
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,500
Will you give your full name?

402
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,580
My name is Falcon Eye of Quails Hollow.

403
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,480
What was your rank within the Order of the Keepers of the Light?

404
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,880
Security Administrator.

405
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,780
According to our new procedures,

406
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,780
you have the right to appoint a Defense Counsel.

407
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,420
I would rather prefer to defend myself,

408
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,240
if you don't mind.

409
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,320
Very well.

410
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,440
Prosecutor,

411
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,560
you may begin your examination.

412
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,820
Falcon Eye,

413
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,280
you are being accused of murder of Brother Fireheart of Coat Lake,

414
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,880
the complicity to murder in at least 300 cases by your involvement with the so-called Cloak and Dagger Decree,

415
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:11,740
and at least another 250 cases by the obliteration of the Rebel Headquarters at Camp Freedom.

416
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,040
What do you have to say regarding these accusations which have been brought against you?

417
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:22,440
I can only say that I asked the Tribunal to decide upon the degree of my guilt at the end of my case.

418
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,200
I, myself,

419
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,840
speaking from the very depths of my feelings,

420
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,880
want to say that now,

421
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,500
after I have gained a full insight into all the horrible deeds which have been committed,

422
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,360
I am possessed by a deep sense of guilt.

423
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
Are you trying to say that you knew nothing about the atrocities at Camp Freedom?

424
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,980
That is hard to believe.

425
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,960
This operation was executed directly by Great Overseer Ironwill.

426
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,080
I had nothing to do with it.

427
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,360
As my fellow brothers can testify,

428
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,880
I was at the Holy Mountain the whole time.

429
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,580
But you also did nothing to stop him.

430
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,880
I did not even know about his plans until he and Brother Strongarm returned with the prisoner.

431
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,920
You were poorly informed for the Chief Overseer Security Administrator.

432
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,120
You cannot prove what I knew or not.

433
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,760
There is no question you knew about the Cloak and Dagger Decree.

434
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,380
I have here the original document, Exhibit FE-001.

435
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,740
Let me quote.

436
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,640
Hence, the Keepers of the Light is,

437
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,580
on principle, the death penalty.

438
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:41,940
Offenses are to be dealt within the field only if it is probable that the sentence of death will be passed upon the offender and the execution can be completed in a very short time.

439
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,760
Otherwise, the offenders are to be taken to the Holy Mountain.

440
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,960
In case anybody inquires about such prisoners,

441
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,780
they are to be told that they have been arrested but the proceedings do not allow any further information.

442
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,360
End quote.

443
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,100
Did you write this decree?

444
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,320
Yes.

445
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,640
So you assume full responsibility?

446
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,020
No.

447
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,380
But you wrote it.

448
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:12,800
Well, there is a principle which says that nobody can transfer more rights to anybody else than he has himself.

449
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,720
I was just a subordinate to great overseer Ironwill.

450
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,520
He wanted to keep the population quiet by demoting an atmosphere of mystery and fear.

451
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,920
Acting pursuant to order of a superior does not relieve you from responsibility.

452
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,780
You could have made a moral choice, but you didn't.

453
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,440
Because of your decree,

454
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,140
hundreds of citizens disappeared overnight,

455
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,580
and their families never knew what happened to them.

456
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,680
Please leave the judging to me,

457
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,560
prosecutor.

458
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,500
I'm sorry, your honor.

459
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,000
I was getting carried away.

460
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,520
Fork and I,

461
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
what about the murder of brother Fireheart?

462
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,360
Are you going to deny responsibility for that too?

463
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,420
I did what I was ordered to do.

464
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,620
These were thankless and difficult tasks.

465
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,900
I had to fulfill the overseer's commands under the hardiest exigencies of duty,

466
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,380
often acting against the inner voice of my conscience and against my own convictions.

467
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:26,860
The fulfillment of urgent tasks assigned by overseer Ironwill demanded complete self-abnegation.

468
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,220
I don't know what to say.

469
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,520
Your honor,

470
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,000
I need a break.

471
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,740
This is my first trial under the new rules,

472
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,300
and staying professional turns out to be a lot harder than I thought.

473
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,000
This is just the first trial of many.

474
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,400
What the Keepers stand for,

475
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,040
we will patiently and temperately disclose.

476
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,940
And we do not depend on their testimony or that of their foes.

477
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,720
We have undeniable proof of incredible events.

478
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,060
The tribunal will now adjourn until ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

479
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:06,600
Come in.

480
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,780
Lady GoldenEyes,

481
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,420
Sir Whisperwind wishes to speak with you.

482
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,600
Finally,

483
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,700
send him in.

484
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,440
Yes, my lady.

485
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,700
Whisperwind, I've been waiting for you all day.

486
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,080
What took you so long?

487
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,960
I'm doing fine, thanks for asking.

488
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,800
How about you, my lady?

489
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,140
So, tell me, how did the mission go?

490
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,020
Without a hitch.

491
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,040
Ivy Dash and Nettlebush made it back from Ferndale in one piece,

492
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,360
and they brought a good dozen hostages with them.

493
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,700
What a great day for the opposition.

494
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,500
How have they been holding up?

495
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,080
Was there a lot of resistance?

496
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
They had an easy time.

497
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,460
The teacher wasn't in the classroom.

498
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,600
All they had to do was round everyone up and go.

499
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,820
That sounds good.

500
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,160
Two of them managed to escape from the wagon during the ride,

501
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,600
but they are not going to be a problem.

502
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,660
And that sounds not so good.

503
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,540
Who were they?

504
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,820
Don't ask me.

505
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,220
One of them was some kind weirdo of Mongrel, the other one...

506
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,080
a pig?

507
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,920
Wait,

508
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,800
what?

509
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,060
A pig?

510
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,940
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what they said.

511
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,480
Why?

512
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,720
Oh, stupid idiots!

513
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,320
I am sorry?

514
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,520
Why didn't they go after them?

515
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,260
The kids are probably already dead,

516
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,880
and if not, they will be soon.

517
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:43,600
Calm down.

518
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,900
Everything will be okay.

519
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,180
The scheme is still going to work.

520
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,700
That's not the point!

521
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,080
Then what is your point?

522
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,820
By the holy mountain,

523
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,760
why do I have to justify everything to you?

524
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,420
Because as your future husband I need to understand what the hell you're up to.

525
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,280
You seem just a bit too eager for your new position.

526
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,760
This is so much more than just a new position.

527
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,800
We are at the beginning of a new age.

528
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,860
Lord Quicksilver, may he rest in peace,

529
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,700
has been gone for many years,

530
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,080
and there is still no legitimate successor.

531
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,680
I am his only heir.

532
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,420
It doesn't get more legitimate than that.

533
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,880
But people don't see you like that.

534
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,980
They see you as the Lord's widow, nothing more.

535
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,040
But as soon as we are Lord and Lady,

536
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,160
this will change, and the opposition will firmly stand behind us.

537
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,080
Don't forget, I still have the powers of the ancestors ready at my fingertips.

538
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,920
And that's good,

539
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,580
but it's a single artifact and it's not going to last forever.

540
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,180
We need to learn how to build our own,

541
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,900
but that might take a long time,

542
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,940
even if the Institute gives us what we want.

543
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,940
And for that you just stirred up the hornet's nest.

544
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,020
Ferndale is a long way from here.

545
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,460
I really don't want anything bad happening to you.

546
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,400
I love you.

547
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,080
Then stop acting like you're already the king of the land!

548
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,940
I have my personal reasons,

549
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,020
and I am still the Princess of Ironforge.

550
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,020
I can do whatever I please.

551
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,180
If you won't go after the escapees,

552
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,400
I will.

553
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,240
But that's crazy.

554
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,040
If the Institute has sent a search party,

555
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,260
there's a good chance you will run straight into it.

556
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,080
Why do these two kids matter so much to you?

557
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,880
Greenfield, get my mount ready.

558
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,780
I need to go out of town.

559
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,980
Meet me in the courtyard in an hour.

560
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
Yes,

561
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,260
my lady.

562
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,560
Your wish is my command.

563
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,720
Golden Eyes, you can't leave so close to the wedding.

564
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,660
What if something happens to you?

565
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,060
I need you here.

566
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,820
Ironforge needs you here.

567
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,220
Then you go! But why?

568
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,720
Is there anything I can do for you, sir?

569
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,240
This woman is giving me a hell of a headache.

570
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,020
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

571
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,660
Would the sir like a glass of water?

572
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,340
Yes, that would be good.

573
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,360
Or wait, could I have a cup of tea instead?

574
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,660
Certainly.

575
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,080
Which kind of tea would the sir prefer?

576
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,580
I'll have rosehip tea,

577
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,160
please.

578
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,180
Rosehip and ginger,

579
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,080
with

580
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,680
a little bit of orange blossom honey.

581
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,280
Yes, could you do that for me?

582
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,520
I'm not sure we have that,

583
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,860
but I shall certainly try.

584
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,620
Thank you very much, Greenfield.

585
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,160
Just take your time.

586
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,460
I am not in a rush.

587
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,620
As you wish,

588
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,640
sir.

589
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,700
I hope that will keep him occupied for a while now.

590
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,300
Let's

591
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,240
see...

592
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,640
She never had second thoughts about our relationship.

593
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,760
Why is she suddenly getting cold feet?

594
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,720
Does she know something I don't?

595
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,840
Also, why does she suddenly bring up the artifact?

596
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,980
Wait a minute...

597
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,540
She used to wear it on her belt pretty much all the time, but not today.

598
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,860
It might just be a coincidence,

599
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,440
but what if it isn't?

600
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,540
Now where does she usually keep that thing?

601
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,280
Ah, there.

602
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:41,820
Now comes the moment of truth.

603
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,240
Oh,

604
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,780
it's not even locked.

605
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,360
Wow.

606
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,900
Now this explains a lot.

607
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,240
Okay, Bottlebrush, that's it.

608
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,820
I am not going to wait any longer.

609
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,460
If you don't act now,

610
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,300
I will.

611
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,920
Oh, Thistlethorn, what happened to knocking first?

612
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,640
I thought Raindancer was like a son to you.

613
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,560
I don't understand how you can just sit there and do nothing.

614
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,040
These are our children,

615
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,480
for the gods sake.

616
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,540
Yes, they are.

617
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,640
And just because I'm not running around like a headless chicken doesn't mean I am doing nothing.

618
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,360
You keep saying that,

619
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,520
but where are the results?

620
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,340
We are running out of time.

621
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,300
Why don't we negotiate with them?

622
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,320
Because you don't negotiate with blackmailers unless you absolutely have to.

623
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,700
But we only have two more days.

624
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,980
Two days can be a lot of time, Thistlethorn.

625
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,560
I trust my men to know what they are doing.

626
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,900
They have already tracked the kidnappers halfway through the dark woods,

627
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,460
and we have narrowed their possible destinations down to less than a handful of cities.

628
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,700
Ha! Less than a handful.

629
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,920
What an achievement.

630
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,640
Look, Bottlebrush, I am not stupid.

631
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,500
It's been raining all night.

632
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,860
If there were any tracks,

633
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,020
they're gone now.

634
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,120
Your experts are stuck.

635
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,000
Why can't you just admit it?

636
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,060
They are using proven scientific methods.

637
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,700
Methods that nobody has ever tried before.

638
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,940
Our ancestors aren't quite nobody,

639
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,540
are they?

640
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,760
You have a smug answer to everything, haven't you?

641
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,380
Professor Bottlebrush,

642
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,280
the smartass in charge.

643
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,560
And yet it is you and your damn institute who got us into all this trouble in the first place.

644
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,740
Hundreds of rebels have died to free our ancestors' thoughts and ideas from their Keepers of the Light,

645
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,100
and you have done nothing better than locking them back up.

646
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,540
The knowledge of an entire civilization put behind iron doors.

647
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,920
No wonder the opposition thinks we're scum.

648
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,540
The Keepers of the Light are gone,

649
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,120
but nothing has changed.

650
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,340
I have a question for you, Thistlethorn.

651
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,380
Do you know what the most defining characteristic of human civilization is?

652
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:58,780
Oh,

653
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,980
enlighten me.

654
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,700
It no longer exists.

655
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,120
The very science that led to its rise also led to its downfall.

656
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,540
Do you want history to repeat itself?

657
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,540
If yes,

658
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,580
go ahead and drop all that human knowledge on our society like a bomb.

659
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,880
If no, we have to share the knowledge responsibly.

660
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,900
That is what our schools are for.

661
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,780
We do not only teach science,

662
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,380
we also teach history and ethics.

663
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,240
Those things must go hand in hand.

664
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,480
I promise you that knowledge will not remain locked up.

665
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,480
We will share it, all of it,

666
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,460
but we'll do it responsibly.

667
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,320
We own the biggest arsenal of weapons in the world.

668
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,600
And yet we let those criminals walk into our classroom with nothing but swords and crossbows and take our kids.

669
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,860
Is that what you call acting responsibly?

670
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,240
Would you have preferred them walking into the classroom with grenades and assault rifles instead?

671
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
That is not what I said.

672
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,480
No?

673
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,380
Then what do you think would happen if we opened the walls underneath the Holy Mountain to everyone?

674
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,260
Thistle, it doesn't work that way.

675
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,540
We will get our sons and daughters back.

676
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,360
And we are going to use weapons if we have to.

677
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,460
But it will be the last thing to try, not the first.

678
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,840
I wouldn't want to live in a world where it is.

679
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,440
Would you?

680
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,260
No.

681
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,800
No, I wouldn't.

682
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:39,900
Queenie, no!

683
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,880
Holy mother of all that is fluffy.

684
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,780
We did it.

685
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,120
That must have been the scariest thing I've ever done in my life.

686
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,200
You get used to it after a while.

687
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,740
I have done this so many times.

688
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,100
I knew it would work.

689
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,700
It always works.

690
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,580
Well,

691
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,920
most of the time anyway.

692
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,380
This better be worth it.

693
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,920
Oh, trust me.

694
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,880
I've been on my own for such a long time.

695
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,300
I know how to get rid of the pig rats.

696
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,040
Just do what I do.

697
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,620
Okay.

698
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,420
Really?

699
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,900
Do I have to?

700
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,180
Oh, come on.

701
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,980
Just do it.

702
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,660
Okay.

703
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,840
Good.

704
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,360
And now we put them on display for the others.

705
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,820
Mine goes over here.

706
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,900
And yours goes over there.

707
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,380
Wow.

708
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,140
This is seriously creepy.

709
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,000
Mm-hmm.

710
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,560
And the great thing is,

711
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,600
it's creepy for other pig rats too.

712
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,720
It will make them stay far away.

713
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,540
That makes a lot of sense.

714
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,580
It must be part of their herd instinct.

715
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,440
Avoiding places where others have died gives them an evolutionary advantage, you know?

716
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,840
Yeah,

717
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,000
exactly that.

718
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,620
Whatever that means.

719
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,480
I

720
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,400
think we can light the fire now.

721
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,260
Oh, yeah.

722
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,240
I can do that.

723
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,760
Just give me a second.

724
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,160
Oh.

725
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,580
Wow.

726
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,940
Wow.

727
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,360
How did you do that so fast?

728
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,320
This is called a lighter.

729
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,520
It's a human artifact.

730
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,300
I took it...

731
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,860
I mean, I borrowed it from Uncle Brushy.

732
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,240
We live in the same house, kind of.

733
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,940
Oh, the good old five-finger discount.

734
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,060
No, no, no.

735
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,840
I was going to give it back.

736
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:17,920
Hmm.

737
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,980
Oh, come on.

738
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,660
Since the keepers are gone,

739
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,720
everyone and their kids is out for the hunt of human artifacts.

740
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,340
I would do the same.

741
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,260
Uncle Brushy can't stop ranting about how everybody is now hoping to find something ancient they can sell for money.

742
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,840
The moment the keepers were gone,

743
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,400
some sites were literally ripped apart by treasure hunters.

744
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,820
Seems like this was one of the few things the keepers did right when they were still around.

745
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,660
A lot of people say there is not much of a difference between the Institute and the keepers.

746
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,660
Who would say such a thing?

747
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,720
The opposition,

748
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,540
for example.

749
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,780
They're wrong.

750
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
The Institute is a scientific organization.

751
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,460
Then why do they guard their knowledge like it's sacred?

752
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,780
Because they're afraid that history will repeat itself.

753
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,940
Our culture is not ready yet.

754
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,740
The Institute works hard to make sure that one day we will be,

755
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,700
but until then, some things are better kept under wraps.

756
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,060
But that's almost exactly what the keepers said.

757
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,940
No, no, no.

758
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,480
You just don't get it.

759
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,480
Whatever.

760
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,400
I'm just a pig.

761
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,080
What am I supposed to know about politics?

762
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,340
Well, you did join us for a reason, didn't you?

763
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,160
Just because of personal reasons.

764
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,260
Nothing political.

765
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,660
Your family?

766
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,280
I don't want to talk about it.

767
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,420
Why?

768
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,380
What happened to them?

769
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,440
Well,

770
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,160
what happened to yours?

771
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,740
Well, my father died saving the world.

772
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,220
And now everybody expects me to do the same.

773
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,980
You're not quite dead yet.

774
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,380
No, and I'm not planning to save the world either.

775
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,680
I just want to learn.

776
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,740
Isn't that the university symbol you are wearing around your neck?

777
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,820
The Tree of Knowledge?

778
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Yeah, my mother gave it to me when I was little.

779
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,120
It has a long history,

780
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,960
like everything else at our home.

781
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,140
There's so much to discover in the old books that I could spend a lifetime in Uncle Brushy's room and never finish it all.

782
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,060
Like all the super secret stuff?

783
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,380
Most of it isn't,

784
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,760
but nobody really cares.

785
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,800
Like what?

786
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
Look at the sky.

787
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,640
Would you believe they could put machines up there?

788
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,440
They put machines up there which stayed there

789
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,420
on their own for hundreds of years.

790
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,500
Most of them have stopped working a long time ago.

791
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,480
And whenever you see a shooting star,

792
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,540
it might actually be one of the old satellites

793
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
burning as it falls back to the earth.

794
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,220
Wow,

795
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,000
that is amazing.

796
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,020
I could go on like that for hours.

797
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,200
I can imagine.

798
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,940
But no matter where we will go,

799
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,740
it's going to be a long walk.

800
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,220
We really should get all the sleep we can.

801
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,240
I don't think I'll be able to.

802
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,040
I never slept outside before.

803
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,020
It's scary and cold.

804
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,820
Then why don't you come over here?

805
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:15,980
And then?

806
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,200
Well,

807
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,380
we could cuddle up and keep each other warm.

808
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,200
What?

809
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,200
But we barely know each other.

810
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,960
Oh, well, we will know each other much better afterwards.

811
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,640
And it will make the night a lot less cold and lonely.

812
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,160
Seriously?

813
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,260
You like to cuddle with random guys?

814
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:36,820
No,

815
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,780
only with those I like.

816
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:39,960
Oh, OK.

817
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,860
Yeah.

818
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,620
Thanks.

819
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,840
What's the problem?

820
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,180
It's going way too fast.

821
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,560
I don't even I mean,

822
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,220
I've not been with.

823
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,160
Oh,

824
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,240
you've never been alone with a girl before.

825
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,940
Wait, wait, time out, time out.

826
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,840
Like not at all at your age.

827
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,960
I mean, how did that happen or rather not happen?

828
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,180
Because I'm a bloody nerd.

829
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,240
And what's the problem with that?

830
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,080
I don't know.

831
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,020
I mean,

832
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,100
you know what?

833
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,180
You don't know what, huh?

834
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,160
How?

835
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,680
How to how how to have sex with a girl?

836
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,120
Oh,

837
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,200
well, don't worry.

838
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,860
I can teach you that.

839
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:29,380
Oh,

840
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,680
come on.

841
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,540
I was just messing with you.

842
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,780
Believe it or not,

843
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,600
I'm cold and lonely, too.

844
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,480
How come you never seem to be afraid of anything?

845
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,740
Because being a pig means having a tough life.

846
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,160
I just stopped being afraid at some point.

847
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,560
And you know what?

848
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,080
Life has been a lot easier since then.

849
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,040
I have to show you something.

850
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,620
OK, what is it?

851
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,360
Just a second.

852
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,620
Have you ever seen something like

853
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,280
this?

854
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,340
Holy fuck.

855
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,300
Point that away from me.

856
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,080
Oh, it seems you have.

857
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,880
Oh, well, don't worry.

858
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,720
It's broken.

859
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,200
It doesn't do anything.

860
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,560
Where on earth did you get this?

861
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:15,760
That

862
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,260
is a gun,

863
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,020
a pistol, a human weapon.

864
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,820
You're not supposed to have that.

865
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,760
If the Institute find out you have that,

866
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,000
then...

867
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,800
Shh, calm down.

868
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,340
Nobody knows.

869
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,420
I found this on my way through the sea of debris.

870
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,780
I was digging for truffles and...

871
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,260
Truffles?

872
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,980
It's a pig thing.

873
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:33,880
OK.

874
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,420
Anyway, this was in a sealed box wrapped in some kind of oily rags.

875
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,720
How did you even know what it was?

876
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,440
I

877
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,580
heard about it before.

878
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,820
It's supposed to contain some kind of evil magic.

879
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,860
But I think it's long gone.

880
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,580
It doesn't do anything.

881
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,440
Oh.

882
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,500
Can I have a look?

883
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,580
Give it to me, please.

884
00:44:59,370 --> 00:44:59,820
Carefully.

885
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,200
OK.

886
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,600
It's not loaded.

887
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,840
But it's in very good condition.

888
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,000
Exceptionally good.

889
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:16,040
I know a few people who would pay a fortune for an artefact like this.

890
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,200
I wasn't going to sell it.

891
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,200
Yeah, and you shouldn't.

892
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,900
If this gets in the wrong hands,

893
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,500
all hell is going to break loose.

894
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,780
It is that dangerous?

895
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,840
Oh,

896
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,620
yes. It's a deadly weapon.

897
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,260
And it cannot only hurt others, but also you.

898
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,920
You have to keep it oiled and clean.

899
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,300
And if there's any rust or dirt blocking the barrel,

900
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,320
it can explode right into your paw.

901
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,460
The bullets go in here,

902
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,880
into the clip down here.

903
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,680
And then you need to flip the safety off here.

904
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,060
Then you work the slide.

905
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,480
And that will move the bullet into the chamber, like this.

906
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,980
And then you point it at your target...

907
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,480
and pull the trigger.

908
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,000
Uncle Brushy let me fire a gun like this once.

909
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:00,500
Wow.

910
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,900
What is it like?

911
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,420
Not very nice.

912
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,880
It makes a really loud bang.

913
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,960
And the recoil makes your paws hurt.

914
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,160
I...

915
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,040
well, you could instantly kill anybody it's pointed at.

916
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,840
It scared the hell out of me.

917
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,400
Wow.

918
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,700
Well, good thing I didn't leave the bag on the carriage.

919
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,780
Unfortunately, a gun is useless without ammunition, so...

920
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,400
I feel so bad about the other students.

921
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,620
We could have saved them.

922
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,120
Hmm.

923
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,140
Maybe we can still do that.

924
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,020
If we only knew where to find some ammunition.

925
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,220
It's ammunition,

926
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,320
not ammunition.

927
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:39,100
Bullets.

928
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,300
But even if we had any,

929
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,580
and we knew how to find the others,

930
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,500
what would you do?

931
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,040
Walk in and kill everybody in your path?

932
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,000
Don't you have at least a little bit of your father's hero blood?

933
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,220
Trivia question.

934
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,600
What is the biggest difference between me and my father?

935
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,700
Beats me.

936
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,540
My father is dead.

937
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,660
Yeah, touche.

938
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,660
That sounded almost literate.

939
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,040
Oh, you!

940
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,380
Don't take me! No, no, no!

941
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,140
See?

942
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,280
I touched you and you didn't die.

943
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,560
Can't you ever take anything serious?

944
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Ah, screw serious!

945
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,060
Survival happens in your head.

946
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,500
Are you sure you want to sleep all alone in the cold?

947
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,800
I promise you don't have to be afraid of me,

948
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,340
or anything else, as long as I am around.

949
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:37,460
Hmm?

950
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,640
Oh, come here.

951
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,680
I will take care of you.

952
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,620
And I'm a lot fluffier than I look.

953
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,980
Oh, what the hell, why not?

954
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,060
Thanks.

955
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,500
You're really nice.

956
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,140
Oh, shh! Don't tell anyone.

957
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:35,040
Oh.

958
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:58,860
Oh

959
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:03,820
Quicksilver,

960
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:09,080
this city is going to the dogs and no matter what I try,

961
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,740
it just keeps getting worse.

962
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,180
Tomorrow is the wedding.

963
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,100
I've been told it's the right thing to do.

964
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,800
The right thing for Ironforge.

965
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:28,960
And yet,

966
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,460
it feels so wrong.

967
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:39,600
I know you believed in Rebaian and that's why you had to join them.

968
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,480
But now that you're dead,

969
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,860
I don't know where to write or write anymore.

970
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:47,240
I miss you so much right now.

971
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,240
For

972
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,000
the last time,

973
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,840
no money, no booze.

974
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,260
Now get the fuck out.

975
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,200
You're a joke.

976
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,920
A fucking joke.

977
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,680
We know where your house lives.

978
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,140
And you're a fucking whore of a wife.

979
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,920
Yeah, I bet she didn't have a good fucking years.

980
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,700
Buy some real men,

981
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,620
not some lame dick like you.

982
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,020
Yeah,

983
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,340
yeah, let's go and fuck her good.

984
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,000
Come on, I still have a few bottles of Golden Marywood at home.

985
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,320
Fuck yeah.

986
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,040
Hey,

987
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,180
what the hell?

988
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,960
Do you see what I see?

989
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:38,780
Where?

990
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,840
Over there.

991
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,780
Isn't that the good lady Golden Eyes?

992
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,660
Holy shit, she's hot.

993
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,980
Hey, what's a pretty kitty like you doing here all alone?

994
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,880
That's none of your business.

995
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:55,400
Well,

996
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,940
if it isn't the grave of Lord Quicksilver,

997
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,260
the old coward.

998
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,220
He was not a coward.

999
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,300
Now get lost.

1000
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,460
Not a coward?

1001
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,400
My ass, he fucking ran away for a bloody rebellion.

1002
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,360
For a rebellion that did nothing.

1003
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,180
You'd better watch your mouth.

1004
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,600
I am the Princess of Ironforge.

1005
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,140
Princess of Ironforge?

1006
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,800
You're not a princess.

1007
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,300
You're a pussy.

1008
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,380
What you gonna do?

1009
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,860
Scratch us with your pretty claws?

1010
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,700
Kill us with your magic stick?

1011
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,340
We ain't got nothing to lose.

1012
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,780
Nothing's worse than living in this shit hole.

1013
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,960
We should remain named to

1014
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,240
Ironforgery.

1015
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:44,780
Fuck you and fuck Lord Quicksilver.

1016
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,320
You know what?

1017
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,620
I'm gonna piss on his grave.

1018
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,900
Oh no, you won't.

1019
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,720
Oh yes, he will.

1020
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,200
Stop.

1021
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,220
Pussy has claws, eh?

1022
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,320
Now that turns me on.

1023
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,460
And me too.

1024
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,880
Hey, pussy, pussy, pussy.

1025
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:15,740
No,

1026
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,700
go away.

1027
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:17,980
Leave me alone.

1028
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,180
Look,

1029
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,420
the pussy wants to play.

1030
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,660
I can see it in her eyes.

1031
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,160
I think she loves you.

1032
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,340
I think so too.

1033
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,520
You little pussy.

1034
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,200
Just watch this, or you'll never have it.

1035
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,540
Give me your pussy paws.

1036
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,380
Help me.

1037
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:39,740
Help.

1038
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,580
Seems she left her magic stick at home.

1039
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,900
Don't worry,

1040
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,980
I've got just the need for her.

1041
00:52:54,830 --> 00:53:01,500
By the gods, are you okay?

1042
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,240
Yes,

1043
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,480
I'm fine.

1044
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,640
It's okay.

1045
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,040
You're safe now.

1046
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,980
Those two aren't going to bother you ever again.

1047
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:18,880
Thanks.

1048
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,300
You're lucky that Greenfell saw you sneaking out.

1049
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,420
Otherwise I wouldn't have known where to find you.

1050
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,300
I'm so sorry.

1051
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,780
Oh, my little kitty.

1052
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,060
When are you going to learn?

1053
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,300
Being a princess means a lot of responsibility.

1054
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,800
I'm sorry too that Quicksilver is gone,

1055
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,620
but now it's up to you to rule this city.

1056
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,020
I can't do it,

1057
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,460
Whisper.

1058
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,560
I just can't do it.

1059
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,040
If you manage to survive just one more night,

1060
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,700
you won't have to carry this burden alone anymore.

1061
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,060
I promise I will be there for you until death do us part.

1062
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,380
My lady,

1063
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,880
I'm neither a soldier nor a wizard.

1064
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,620
To ensure your personal safety,

1065
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,560
I would kindly request that you coordinate any nightly excursions with me first.

1066
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,860
Are you putting me under arrest?

1067
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,220
Of course not.

1068
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:20,420
How am I supposed to take care of my city when I'm locked up at the palace like a scourge in a museum?

1069
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,740
I need to be out here with the people in the city I grew up in.

1070
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,740
I can't believe this is coming from the same woman who nearly got raped five minutes ago.

1071
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,640
Would you have preferred we hadn't come for you?

1072
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,060
I know I made a mistake.

1073
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,440
And of course, I'm glad you came.

1074
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,980
Next time I'll be more careful.

1075
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,180
That won't be enough.

1076
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,280
Ironforge has changed.

1077
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,480
A lot of people want your throne.

1078
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,520
It might change when we can finally build our own firearms,

1079
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,080
but until then it's not safe out here.

1080
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,640
Weapons, weapons, weapons!

1081
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,740
For you, it's all about weapons!

1082
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,960
Everyone's going at each other's throats.

1083
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:00,880
Chaos.

1084
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:01,860
Anarchy.

1085
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,560
Building our own firearms will be the only way to ensure our freedom.

1086
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,620
But instead of giving us the blueprints we need,

1087
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,540
the Institute keeps them locked up in their ivory tower just like the Keepers did.

1088
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,580
I know.

1089
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:23,860
Then please tell me why I just had to save the woman who owns the most powerful killing device on this side of the Serpent River.

1090
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,640
Because this place is a sanctuary.

1091
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,640
I came here to grieve,

1092
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,900
not to kill.

1093
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,860
I'm sorry.

1094
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,740
You could have died tonight.

1095
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,100
I was worried.

1096
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,280
You're right.

1097
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,380
I should have been more careful.

1098
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,200
Do you still love me?

1099
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:47,920
Of course I do.

1100
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,540
I know I love you too.

1101
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,800
Now you go home with the guards.

1102
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,680
I'll stay here with Greenfield and clean up this mess, alright?

1103
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,920
The last thing we want is a public outrage.

1104
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:00,740
Alright.

1105
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,380
Good night, my love.

1106
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,020
Good night.

1107
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,200
Greenfield,

1108
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,140
let's get these bodies out of sight.

1109
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,940
We'll drop them by the mortuary so the Undertaker can take care of them tomorrow morning.

1110
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,180
You take the arms,

1111
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,560
I'll take the legs.

1112
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,020
Yes, sir.

1113
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,580
Heavy bastard.

1114
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,220
How ironic.

1115
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,680
Shot in a cemetery.

1116
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,180
I

1117
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,860
hate killing people in public places.

1118
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,100
So many precious lives lost every day.

1119
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:48,880
It's a tragedy.

1120
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,980
You know,

1121
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,160
the worst thing is the paperwork.

1122
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,440
They want to know everything.

1123
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,620
Why,

1124
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,420
how,

1125
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,200
when,

1126
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,000
where.

1127
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,700
Once I'm Lord of Ironforge,

1128
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,140
this will get so much simpler.

1129
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,020
I beg your pardon, sir?

1130
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,440
The city needs a proper Lord again.

1131
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,860
GoldenEyes is just too sensitive,

1132
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,160
too soft.

1133
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,760
You know what I mean.

1134
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,580
I'm not entirely sure I do,

1135
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,000
sir.

1136
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,020
And I still don't get why she didn't bring her gun.

1137
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,880
I mean, I know the whole killing business is not her thing,

1138
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,740
but she knows how dangerous it is out here at night.

1139
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,540
Yes,

1140
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,500
sir.

1141
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,580
Very peculiar,

1142
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,060
sir.

1143
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,140
Stop playing dumb, Greenfield.

1144
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,760
She doesn't have it anymore,

1145
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:49,780
am I right?

1146
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,480
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

1147
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,440
Oh, look how late it is.

1148
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,640
I have to be right back.

1149
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:00,440
Greenfield.

1150
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,740
Please,

1151
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:04,720
sir.

1152
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,220
If I tell you this,

1153
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,820
she's going to shoot me.

1154
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,000
Greenfield.

1155
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,020
First of all,

1156
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,580
you just gave it away.

1157
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,560
Secondly,

1158
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:19,340
how?

1159
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,220
I'm sorry, sir.

1160
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,980
I'm not very good at politics.

1161
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,180
That's fine, Greenfield.

1162
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,940
Just tell me what you know.

1163
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,600
Where is the gun?

1164
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,400
It was stolen.

1165
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,280
What?

1166
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,900
How the hell did that happen?

1167
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:41,580
Someone took it from a study and left without a trace.

1168
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,200
And even stranger,

1169
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,260
the bullets are still there.

1170
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,380
And when was that?

1171
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,540
The day after the execution.

1172
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:50,720
The spy?

1173
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:51,860
Yes,

1174
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:52,720
the pig,

1175
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:53,340
sir.

1176
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,500
Anyways,

1177
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,000
bullets are no bullets.

1178
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,900
We need to get that gun back.

1179
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,320
Greenfield,

1180
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,760
go and see after her.

1181
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,420
I'll be with you in a moment.

1182
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,360
Yes,

1183
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:06,020
sir.

1184
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:16,340
Oh, Quicksilver, my old friend.

1185
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,860
You were always so idealistic,

1186
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,880
so courageous,

1187
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,880
and so wrong.

1188
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,600
Ironforge could be the capital of the world,

1189
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,160
but you never realized that.

1190
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,420
What am I supposed to do with your lady?

1191
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,720
She's becoming a serious threat to my plans.

1192
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,820
Any ideas?

1193
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,120
No.

1194
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,800
Thought so.

1195
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,160
Sorry for invading your family like that old chap.

1196
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,500
But if that's what it takes to make Ironforge great again,

1197
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,060
it has to be done.

1198
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:50,900
Wait.

1199
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:52,780
Family.

1200
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,740
That's how it all makes sense.

1201
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,420
Quicksilver,

1202
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,920
as much as I enjoyed this conversation,

1203
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,780
I have to take my leave.

1204
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,080
That's it.

1205
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,500
I'm done for today.

1206
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,720
It's getting dark and my paws hurt.

1207
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:43,780
How about you?

1208
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,920
There's something under this rock.

1209
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,500
I can't hear it.

1210
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,860
Maybe it's a bunker or a secret weapons stash.

1211
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,320
Dream on.

1212
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,880
Shut up and help me pry this thing open.

1213
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,140
Okay, but this'll be the last thing I'll do for tonight.

1214
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,760
There.

1215
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,200
An opening.

1216
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,380
I knew it.

1217
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:08,900
And?

1218
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,300
Can you see something?

1219
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,860
It's full of water.

1220
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,000
Of course.

1221
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,160
What did you expect?

1222
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,300
I have to find out what's in there.

1223
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,340
No, be careful.

1224
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,100
You don't know how deep it is.

1225
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,620
I am an otter, stupid.

1226
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,760
Oh,

1227
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,580
damn it.

1228
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:26,220
What is it?

1229
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,820
Nothing down here but slimy daivery.

1230
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:33,180
Not exactly unusual for the ruins of a 500-year-old war zone.

1231
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,680
A smartass.

1232
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,420
Wait, what is this?

1233
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:38,940
A box?

1234
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,080
Yes.

1235
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,540
A small metal crate.

1236
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:44,520
And wow,

1237
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,220
it's much lighter than I thought.

1238
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,360
Yeah, that probably means it's empty.

1239
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,940
Empty means there's no water in it.

1240
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,620
This might be our lucky day, pal.

1241
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,240
I'll believe it when I see it.

1242
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,160
Bring it up here.

1243
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,000
Oh, something you're all interested in again.

1244
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,640
Here, catch.

1245
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:04,740
Hmm.

1246
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,180
It's made of this super light metal that doesn't rust.

1247
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,520
That alone is going to fetch a good price.

1248
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,280
The lock was apparently made of iron.

1249
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:14,960
It's almost completely gone.

1250
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,080
What are you waiting for?

1251
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,380
Open it.

1252
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,160
Oh, my goodness, you were right.

1253
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,080
This is our lucky day.

1254
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,120
Now look what we have here.

1255
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,320
It's a pistol and matching bullets.

1256
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,940
In the best condition I've ever seen.

1257
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,240
Barely any rust.

1258
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,880
And it just works after so many centuries.

1259
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,380
How crazy is that?

1260
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,180
The humans made the most amazing materials.

1261
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,980
This thing is worth a fortune.

1262
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,520
We should bring it to the Institute.

1263
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,040
No, are you nuts?

1264
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,120
All they're going to do is confiscate it and lock it up with the thousands they already have.

1265
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,780
And pay a very good reward.

1266
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,920
That is nothing compared to what the opposition would pay.

1267
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,920
But that would be totally irresponsible.

1268
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,160
Says the grave robber.

1269
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,620
This weapon is not some ancient human trinket.

1270
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,360
If you're not going to report it,

1271
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,100
I will.

1272
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,560
In the wrong hands,

1273
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,280
it could kill hundreds of people,

1274
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:15,720
if not thousands.

1275
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:16,740
Thousands?

1276
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,460
You're exaggerating.

1277
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,080
Just one is enough.

1278
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,140
What do you mean?

1279
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,700
I told you the Sea of Debris is a dangerous place.

1280
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,560
I would have shared with you.

1281
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,340
Too bad you'd rather die than be rich.

1282
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,900
Farewell, my friend.

1283
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,960
And rest in peace.

1284
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,560
Finally, we're getting out of this damn forest.

1285
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,120
I still have no idea where we are,

1286
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,920
but where there's a road,

1287
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,140
there must be a destination.

1288
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,960
This must be one of the old roads that the humans built.

1289
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,720
What makes you think that?

1290
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,600
Well, because it's made of concrete.

1291
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,400
Oh, well, a good thing it's not made of abstract.

1292
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,580
Very funny.

1293
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,520
Concrete is a sort of man-made rock.

1294
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,260
They used it to build houses and roads and bridges.

1295
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,180
Everything that needed to last centuries or longer.

1296
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,200
Like this road here.

1297
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,780
You're like a walking lexiclopedia.

1298
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,620
It's encyclopedia.

1299
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,100
You're so cute when you try to talk like me.

1300
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,360
Don't you think we make a great team?

1301
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,860
I'm all theory and you're all practice.

1302
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:12,480
I think you mean I do all the heavy lifting and you won't stop talking.

1303
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,660
I need a break.

1304
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,440
My back is killing me.

1305
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,100
Well,

1306
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:20,560
then

1307
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,680
come over here and

1308
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,980
sit down for a moment.

1309
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,040
What for?

1310
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,160
Just do it.

1311
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:27,500
Okay.

1312
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,100
What?

1313
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,820
Oh,

1314
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:43,420
that's good.

1315
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,300
Please don't stop.

1316
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,060
See, I'm not all that useless, am I?

1317
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:51,300
Your muscles are really tense.

1318
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,720
If it hurts, tell me.

1319
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,220
I don't think that you can even hurt me.

1320
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,440
Sorry.

1321
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,700
No, no, no.

1322
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,280
Gone.

1323
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,360
It hurts, but it hurts so good.

1324
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:07,980
Okay.

1325
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,740
You know what?

1326
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,180
I've never felt safer than with you around.

1327
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,380
And I usually don't trust people easily.

1328
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:21,820
Really?

1329
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:24,960
But you know so much about the world.

1330
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,300
I have learned more from you than from any other class before.

1331
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,780
And at school, you were the only one who didn't make fun of me.

1332
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,840
That means a lot to me.

1333
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,960
Well, you're lucky then.

1334
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,240
It seems we are stuck with each other for a while.

1335
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:42,340
It could be a lot worse, right?

1336
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,740
Yeah, sure could.

1337
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,600
By the way, I'm getting hungry.

1338
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,060
I could really go for a piece of roasted pig right now.

1339
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,900
Is there any left?

1340
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:53,820
Oh, thank you.

1341
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:54,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1342
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,000
There should be plenty left.

1343
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,100
It's ra...

1344
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,100
Where the hell did my bag go?

1345
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:02,840
Uh, what?

1346
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,580
I could swear I put it right here.

1347
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,640
I can still smell it.

1348
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:16,360
Oh, by the way, these are the remnants of an old communication system

1349
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,700
that was ancient even by human standards.

1350
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,980
And it was used to...

1351
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,100
People could...

1352
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,500
Uh-huh.

1353
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,880
I think I found a thief.

1354
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:33,080
Hey, I know you're in there.

1355
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,960
Give us our food back.

1356
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,740
Hey there, open up.

1357
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,460
Whoa,

1358
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,600
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What?

1359
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,500
Okay, you want trouble?

1360
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,920
You can get trouble.

1361
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:52,280
I am going to puff and puff and shake

1362
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:54,060
this...

1363
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,560
We give up.

1364
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,480
We give up.

1365
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,900
Here's your food.

1366
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:02,500
What?

1367
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:04,980
There's barely half of it left.

1368
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:05,740
You thieves.

1369
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:09,840
Have mercy.

1370
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:11,960
It's hard to get by these days.

1371
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:12,980
So hard.

1372
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,640
We've been living on nothing but grubs today.

1373
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,060
And yesterday.

1374
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,200
And tomorrow.

1375
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:20,940
Now that didn't make any sense.

1376
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:21,660
Of course it didn't.

1377
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,960
Then you brought pig rats.

1378
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:26,860
So tasty.

1379
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,820
So tasty.

1380
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,740
So tasty.

1381
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:32,480
So... Stop!

1382
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,980
I think we got the message.

1383
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,800
So you're living in this

1384
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,020
thing?

1385
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:41,000
Phone booth.

1386
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:41,960
Whatever.

1387
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,580
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1388
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,860
Most definitely, yes.

1389
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,260
Always have.

1390
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,800
Always will.

1391
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,080
Then you can tell me where we are, right?

1392
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:50,920
Of course.

1393
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,800
Why do you even ask?

1394
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,540
It's so obvious.

1395
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,260
Okay,

1396
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,140
then, okay.

1397
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,500
Where are we?

1398
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,280
You are no longer where you came from.

1399
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,000
You're not yet where you're going.

1400
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,220
Right now, you are right here.

1401
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,020
Are you making fun of us?

1402
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:12,440
Are you?

1403
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:13,360
No.

1404
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:14,600
Are you?

1405
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:15,380
No.

1406
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,280
Are you?

1407
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,780
I don't think we are.

1408
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,040
Now

1409
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,160
listen to me.

1410
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,660
Do you see this guy over there?

1411
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:29,500
Hi.

1412
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,780
That is Rain Dancer.

1413
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,440
And he knows how to set things on fire.

1414
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,620
This includes that funny chicken shed of yours.

1415
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,740
Phone booth.

1416
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,480
So if you want to see the light of another day,

1417
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,600
you better stop playing games with me.

1418
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,140
Do you hear me, Mr.

1419
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,040
Rubber Chicken?

1420
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,520
I'm a rubber chicken.

1421
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:59,060
I wonder if they taste like one.

1422
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,200
All right, all right.

1423
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,400
You win.

1424
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,580
We lose.

1425
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,220
My neck pipe.

1426
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,400
It's gone.

1427
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:10,020
One last time.

1428
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,700
Where are we?

1429
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,500
You are on the road to Iron Forge.

1430
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,780
The glorious capital of the Iron Land.

1431
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:21,320
The city of milk and pancakes.

1432
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,060
Iron Forge.

1433
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,240
Now that makes a lot of sense.

1434
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,880
The idiot on the carriage,

1435
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,160
he mentioned Lady Golden Eyes.

1436
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:29,700
Oh,

1437
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:32,400
the wonderful Lady Golden Eyes.

1438
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,160
Princess of Iron Forge.

1439
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:37,000
Her eyes are so golden.

1440
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:38,480
So

1441
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,420
that's where they've been trying to take us.

1442
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,020
And that must be where the other students are.

1443
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,200
We should go immediately back to Ferndale and tell everybody.

1444
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:47,620
No,

1445
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,440
we must go to Iron Forge and save the students.

1446
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,840
And how are we supposed to do that?

1447
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,360
With no weapons and no backup?

1448
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,460
No nothing?

1449
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,100
No, no, no, no, no.

1450
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,000
You should definitely not go to Iron Forge.

1451
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,900
Everyone wants the Lady's throne.

1452
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,080
It's not safe.

1453
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,320
She won't last long, that's for sure.

1454
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:09,480
And how do you think we should go back to Ferndale?

1455
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:10,360
On foot?

1456
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,060
That will take at least a week and it's still pretty dangerous.

1457
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,480
Oh, yes.

1458
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,660
The woods are where the snapjaw lives.

1459
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,020
Nasty snapping bites, you creatures.

1460
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,860
But the pig rats are so tasty.

1461
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:23,760
Birds,

1462
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,140
can you please make up your mind?

1463
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,280
You're not helping.

1464
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:27,820
Yes.

1465
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:28,320
No.

1466
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,340
Maybe.

1467
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:32,800
Rainy,

1468
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,280
hand me the lighter.

1469
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:36,340
Look,

1470
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:36,920
look.

1471
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,720
Someone is coming up the road.

1472
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:39,920
Stranger danger.

1473
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:40,860
We must hide.

1474
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,820
Should we hide too?

1475
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,520
It's too late.

1476
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,060
We need to disguise.

1477
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,820
Just play along, okay?

1478
01:11:52,440 --> 01:12:02,420
Oh,

1479
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,360
lookie there.

1480
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:13,680
Isn't there a more beautiful sight than the flowering of new love in the time of spring?

1481
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,300
That was more like a deflowering.

1482
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,960
Oh, hello there.

1483
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

1484
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,340
We really didn't expect anyone to come by so suddenly.

1485
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,800
Oh, don't mind me.

1486
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,840
I am just a dirty old man thinking about the time long ago.

1487
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,600
Well,

1488
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,780
my name is

1489
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:51,380
Daisy Puff and this is my fiancée.

1490
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,720
It talks a lot.

1491
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:55,640
I

1492
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,880
hate you.

1493
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,820
I'm an old man and yeah,

1494
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,700
you know,

1495
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,640
my ears are not so good.

1496
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:07,700
How are your names?

1497
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,560
Excuse me.

1498
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,280
Daisy Puff it was.

1499
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,040
And my fiancée talks a lot.

1500
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,220
Talks a lot, yeah.

1501
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,320
My name is Amber Leaves and Ironforge is my humble home.

1502
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:23,100
I haven't seen you two around here before.

1503
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,800
We are pleased to make your acquaintance.

1504
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,380
Pleased to make your acquaintance too.

1505
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:35,060
Oh, well, isn't this a strange coincidence?

1506
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:38,760
We were just taking a break on our way to Ironforge.

1507
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,640
Do you think you could give us a ride?

1508
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,080
Of course I can.

1509
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:48,020
This is your first time to Ironforge and right on time for the big celebration.

1510
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:48,900
Oh, really?

1511
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,680
Yes, Lady GoldenEyes is going to get married.

1512
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:54,700
After so many years,

1513
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,200
Ironforge is finally getting to have a proper royal couple again.

1514
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,860
The entire town is throwing a one big party.

1515
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,200
You should definitely go and see it.

1516
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,400
Oh, of course.

1517
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:06,900
I love weddings.

1518
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:08,160
But

1519
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,220
when we arrive at Ironforge,

1520
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,340
first thing we do is look for help.

1521
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:13,640
Okay,

1522
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,760
Uncle Brushy used to have some good friends in Ironforge.

1523
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:17,660
One of them is Longleaf,

1524
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,080
a very nice fellow.

1525
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,260
As far as I know,

1526
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,320
he runs a bakery there.

1527
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:25,180
We'll find him and then we'll tell the Institute and let them handle everything.

1528
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:28,040
And then we can enjoy the celebration.

1529
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:28,420
Okay?

1530
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,080
Oh, okay.

1531
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,320
Before we go,

1532
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,280
I have one humble request.

1533
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,320
You see, my horse is thirsty and there is a little stream nearby.

1534
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,460
Daisypuff,

1535
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,940
could you help me getting some water?

1536
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,660
And it's just a short walk and you talk a lot.

1537
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:51,280
Maybe you could stay here and keep an eye on old Patsy.

1538
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:52,780
Oh, sure.

1539
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:53,460
Of course.

1540
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:53,860
Sure.

1541
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:55,260
No problem.

1542
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,700
Easy, easy.

1543
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,620
He's going to be back very soon.

1544
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:03,740
Easy.

1545
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,100
There you go.

1546
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,660
I know who you are, poor tummy.

1547
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:10,700
Shh.

1548
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,020
Don't worry.

1549
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:14,680
I'm your friend.

1550
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:20,260
It seems we both have a common enemy and I'm going to make you an offer that you will appreciate.

1551
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,860
I'm sure it's

1552
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,500
right here in this bag.

1553
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,420
Let's talk about it while we walk and

1554
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,860
no word to the other guy, okay?

1555
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,600
This will be our little secret.

1556
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:54,800
Golden Eyes! Wake up,

1557
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:54,980
honey.

1558
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,880
Wake up! Quicksilver?

1559
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,020
What is it?

1560
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,140
I have to leave.

1561
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,120
Now?

1562
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,720
In the middle of the night?

1563
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:03,980
Someone blew the whistle.

1564
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,580
The Keepers are after me.

1565
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,320
Greenfield is trying to stall them,

1566
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,700
but I don't have much time.

1567
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,640
Please tell me that's a joke.

1568
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,320
I wish it were.

1569
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:13,420
Oh, no.

1570
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,700
Oh, no.

1571
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,560
I told you not to deal with the Rebels,

1572
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:18,840
but you...

1573
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,040
you goddamn bastard.

1574
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,380
Don't cry.

1575
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,760
But when they get you,

1576
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,700
they will kill you.

1577
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,980
I won't let that happen.

1578
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:29,100
I promise.

1579
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,460
But I really have to go now.

1580
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:32,780
Go where?

1581
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:33,760
To Camp Freedom,

1582
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,960
the secret base at the Rebel Underground.

1583
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,960
You are joining them?

1584
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,040
It's now or never.

1585
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,040
But I love you.

1586
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,080
You can't just leave me like that.

1587
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:43,240
I love you, too.

1588
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:46,180
But right now, it's my only chance to survive.

1589
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,360
And I'll be back.

1590
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,380
I promise.

1591
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,140
What about Ironforge?

1592
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,780
Who's going to run this city while you're away?

1593
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,400
You're the Princess.

1594
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:55,940
Have you forgotten that?

1595
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,020
I can't do this without you.

1596
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,240
Oh, yes, you can.

1597
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,120
You know a lot more about ruling this city than anybody else.

1598
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,280
And it will only be for a short time.

1599
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,640
Stormrunner has an excellent plan.

1600
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:08,740
You will see.

1601
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,680
The tyranny of the Keepers will be over very soon.

1602
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:15,280
I'm sorry, but these are the Lord's and Lady's private rooms.

1603
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,240
I cannot let you enter without permission.

1604
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,680
I'm sorry, too, but your permission is irrelevant.

1605
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:20,900
I love you.

1606
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,920
Oh, for the God's sake,

1607
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,060
get me that door open.

1608
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:27,380
Goddamn.

1609
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,040
I've spent too much time talking.

1610
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,400
I have to leave.

1611
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,180
Through the window?

1612
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,220
There's no other way.

1613
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:36,840
I love your golden eyes.

1614
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,520
I'll see you after the revolution.

1615
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,500
Quick, Silver!

1616
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,700
All right.

1617
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:47,720
Where is she?

1618
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:48,920
Talk to me, woman.

1619
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

1620
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,180
The window.

1621
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,360
Damn, there he goes.

1622
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,660
Why in the God's name is nobody down there?

1623
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,040
Don't stare at me like that.

1624
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,160
Run, get him!

1625
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:13,160
Oh,

1626
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,260
there we are.

1627
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,500
The marketplace.

1628
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:21,720
If there's one place we find friends of the Interst Institute, then it's here.

1629
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:26,900
So many people and everyone is wearing their finest for the big ceremony.

1630
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,680
Look around for anybody wearing the Tree of Knowledge.

1631
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:33,160
I wonder what kind of dress Lady Golden Eyes is going to wear.

1632
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,700
Forget the wedding for a moment.

1633
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,600
We must find Longleaf first.

1634
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:37,140
Oh,

1635
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:41,460
but I've never seen a royal wedding before in my whole life.

1636
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:46,440
How about you stay here and keep searching and I watch the ceremony?

1637
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,480
I'm sure it won't take long.

1638
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,580
It's not like I'll be able to stop you anyway,

1639
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:52,920
right?

1640
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,240
Damn straight.

1641
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,600
I'll be at the front.

1642
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,420
Be safe.

1643
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,240
OK.

1644
01:18:59,200 --> 01:18:59,920
Be safe?

1645
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,640
Why would I not?

1646
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:14,960
Hear ye,

1647
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,040
hear ye.

1648
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,960
Thank you very much to all for your presence and affection on this day.

1649
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,660
Windsor Whisperwind,

1650
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:26,240
the city's wealthiest entrepreneur and long-time consultant to the house,

1651
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,800
receive the hand of our beloved Lady Golden Eyes,

1652
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,560
Princess of Fire and Forge.

1653
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,360
My dearest Golden Eyes,

1654
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:54,000
many may believe that it was a fairy tale the way we came together.

1655
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,560
And of course,

1656
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:56,760
they are right.

1657
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:02,720
It is always a fairy tale the way two people come together and decide to share life.

1658
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,800
Yes, indeed, you are the Princess of Iron Forge,

1659
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:10,240
but this cannot separate you from which you also represent.

1660
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,880
You are built by your heritage and your role,

1661
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:16,480
which makes you the person you are today,

1662
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,140
ripe and ready for the tasks you have chosen in your life.

1663
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,920
We see you as the revelation of sincerity and diligence.

1664
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,160
And during the time we have known each other,

1665
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,280
I have constantly been thinking of this.

1666
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,380
Are we really meant for each other?

1667
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,380
Then fate will surely arrange it all to the best.

1668
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:47,500
The promise made today and the ties that abound here will greatly strengthen your union.

1669
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,520
They will cross the years and lifts of each soul's growth.

1670
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:56,260
Do you still seek to enter the ceremony?

1671
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:57,740
Yes,

1672
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,260
we seek to enter.

1673
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:01,860
Whisperwind,

1674
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,180
will you cause her pain?

1675
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,160
I may.

1676
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,960
Is that your intent?

1677
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:07,840
No.

1678
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,360
Golden Eyes,

1679
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,500
will you cause him pain?

1680
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,620
I may.

1681
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,680
Is that your intent?

1682
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:17,740
No.

1683
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:22,560
Will both of you share each other's pain and seek it?

1684
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,120
Yes, we will.

1685
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,080
Above you are the stars.

1686
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,340
Below you are the stones.

1687
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,680
As time passes,

1688
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,420
remember,

1689
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,660
like the stone, your love should be firm.

1690
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,840
Like the stars, your love should be constant.

1691
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,500
Let the strength of your wills bind you together.

1692
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,260
You may now kiss.

1693
01:21:55,910 --> 01:22:03,500
Let it be known that Whisperwind and Golden Eyes are in law and lady of Fire and Forge.

1694
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:15,080
Hotami! Hotami! No! No!

1695
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,560
This one is for my mother!

1696
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:24,160
Hotami! You don't know...

1697
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,500
You don't know what you're doing!

1698
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:32,340
I told you not to come after me! Now you've ruined everything!

1699
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:34,300
What the hell did you just do?

1700
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,320
I made history! What?

1701
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,040
Run!

1702
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,500
Don't talk! Run!

1703
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,100
What the...

1704
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,680
Guards! Where are the guards?

1705
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,700
Come on, run!

1706
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,180
Oh, shit!

1707
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:52,260
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

1708
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,900
The assassins are fleeing! Cease them!

1709
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:57,480
Oh, come on!

1710
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:58,960
Come on, horse!

1711
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,680
Hold on! It's going to be a bumpy ride!

1712
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:24,420
Who is there?

1713
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,000
It's me, Whisperwind.

1714
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:26,380
Oh.

1715
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,440
To what do I owe the honor of this unexpected visit?

1716
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,720
Oh, I just happened to be nearby,

1717
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:36,760
and I thought, why not pay the old hammerfist a visit?

1718
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,700
Well, it's always a pleasure to welcome a good customer,

1719
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,400
but I'm sure you're not here for some idle chatter.

1720
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:43,780
You know me too well.

1721
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,660
How is the work on the gun going?

1722
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,060
Well, we...

1723
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:51,100
I don't think we can do it.

1724
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,560
This is not what I wanted to hear.

1725
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:54,240
I know,

1726
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,660
I know, but I'm an honest man,

1727
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,060
so I'm telling you like it is.

1728
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,860
This is THE Literal Ironforge,

1729
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,060
the one that this city is named for,

1730
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,260
well known far beyond its limits.

1731
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,120
And you are telling me you can't build a little device with less than a dozen parts?

1732
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,720
Not even with a model to work from?

1733
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:15,060
I am deeply

1734
01:24:15,710 --> 01:24:16,260
disappointed.

1735
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,580
Oh, it is a small device, that's true.

1736
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,160
But there's a lot more to it than meets the eye.

1737
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,720
The humans were amazing blacksmiths.

1738
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,140
Then consider it a challenge!

1739
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,700
This is a challenge,

1740
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:27,860
if I've ever seen one.

1741
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,400
Did you get to examine the ammunition I sent you?

1742
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,140
Of course.

1743
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,060
The bullets are like pieces of art,

1744
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,040
each one a marvel of precision.

1745
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,280
I've never seen anything like it before.

1746
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,220
I think we could make a few,

1747
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,860
but it will take a long time and a lot of work.

1748
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,460
Then what are you waiting for?

1749
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:44,460
Get down to it!

1750
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,680
I'm beginning to wonder what the hell

1751
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,620
I'm paying you for.

1752
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,400
Yes, sir.

1753
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,300
Of course, sir.

1754
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:50,700
I hope you are aware

1755
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:55,200
though that the bullets will be useless without the black powder that makes them go bang.

1756
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,380
Do I look like an idiot?

1757
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,460
The finest alchemists of the city are working on it.

1758
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,820
As soon as we have figured out the formula,

1759
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,080
you will get your powder.

1760
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,760
Now what is keeping us from

1761
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,320
building our own guns again?

1762
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:07,220
The material.

1763
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,540
Even our strongest iron does not seem to be hard enough.

1764
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:11,640
Not hard enough?

1765
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,820
You are known to make the hardest iron in the world.

1766
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,120
It is like it is.

1767
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:20,420
We've not been able to fire more than a handful of shots before the gun breaks.

1768
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:22,480
And the aim is terrible.

1769
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,180
I'm at my wits end.

1770
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:26,120
I paid you a fortune to produce

1771
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,480
a reliable gun and you said you can do it.

1772
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,100
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

1773
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:31,320
And if you want your

1774
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,400
money back, I can totally understand that.

1775
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:35,400
Let me talk to the cashier and I...

1776
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,560
Listen to me, you little dimwit.

1777
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,360
I am Whisperwind of Ironforge.

1778
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:43,160
You don't bail out on me like that.

1779
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:46,480
There are not many parts of the city that I do not own.

1780
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,940
These guns were built before

1781
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,300
and if you ever want to do any business in this town again,

1782
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,040
you are going to find out

1783
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,100
how to build them again.

1784
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,300
Understood?

1785
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:59,020
But it is...

1786
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:01,620
but it is impossible.

1787
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,280
Then what would it take to make it possible?

1788
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,360
The knowledge of a human blacksmith.

1789
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,360
All right,

1790
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,180
then this is what I shall get for you.

1791
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:12,820
And how are you going to do that?

1792
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:16,680
Break into the Holy Mountain and steal all their books?

1793
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:20,040
There is no need to break in if you know who has the key.

1794
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,300
I have to go and make a few arrangements.

1795
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,420
You're going to hear from me.

1796
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,880
Please excuse me.

1797
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:31,560
Ah...

1798
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:39,220
Hold still.

1799
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:43,320
Slow.

1800
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:45,860
Come on.

1801
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,640
Careful, careful.

1802
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,480
Oh, fuck.

1803
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:50,540
It hurts.

1804
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:54,880
Don't move your arm.

1805
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,040
It looks a lot worse than it is.

1806
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,100
Don't touch me.

1807
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,720
I just want to help you.

1808
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,240
I said don't touch me! Please,

1809
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,320
Rainy.

1810
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:05,800
Let me explain.

1811
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,440
Shut

1812
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:08,360
up.

1813
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:09,920
Just shut up! No,

1814
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:10,980
no.

1815
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,700
Please, let me explain.

1816
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,240
Just don't move your arm, okay?

1817
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:21,860
No, no, no, don't touch it.

1818
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:22,600
Don't pull it.

1819
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,700
Don't.

1820
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,020
It will just...

1821
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,120
Great.

1822
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,000
Now you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

1823
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:33,680
So what?

1824
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,060
You are going to die if we don't stop it.

1825
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:41,620
Come here.

1826
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,440
I told you to leave me alone.

1827
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:45,240
Hold

1828
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:47,460
still.

1829
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,040
By the gods.

1830
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,420
Why can't you just...

1831
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:55,500
Why can't you just leave me alone?

1832
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,820
Because I care about you.

1833
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,320
Then why did you do this to me?

1834
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,220
Look,

1835
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,580
I didn't want this to happen to you.

1836
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,540
You shot the princess.

1837
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,380
You shot the goddamn princess.

1838
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,980
What the fuck did you expect?

1839
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:16,920
This barn hasn't been used since old Barleycorn gave up his farm.

1840
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,040
We will be safe here if you stop yelling.

1841
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,120
You know this place?

1842
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,640
This is where I grew up.

1843
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:29,540
Wait.

1844
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,560
You grew up in Ironforge?

1845
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,300
Until I ran away.

1846
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,220
Why didn't you tell me?

1847
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,420
Because...

1848
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,980
You better be honest with me now.

1849
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:49,700
Because I was afraid you would hate me.

1850
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:51,520
Go on.

1851
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,220
My father died in the rebellion.

1852
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:59,340
I grew up only with my mother and we were the only Riverhawks in town.

1853
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:07,120
Ironforge has always been firmly in the hands of the opposition and there is just no place for pigs in their vision of a new world.

1854
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,320
The Institute took us in.

1855
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:16,860
People tend to underestimate the wits of a hawk and that made mother a perfect spy against the opposition.

1856
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:20,400
She was the one who uncovered the opposition's war plans.

1857
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,340
War plans?

1858
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:27,940
The sea of debris is littered with human artifacts.

1859
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,120
But working weapons are extremely rare.

1860
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:37,440
They've been trying to recreate some of the artifacts they found but with no success.

1861
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:42,020
Are you a spy too?

1862
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:42,900
No.

1863
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:45,880
I wasn't supposed to know any about this.

1864
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,640
But I was curious.

1865
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,780
When I pressed my ear against the wall in my room I just could hear everything they said.

1866
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,660
Where is your mother now?

1867
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:57,120
She's dead.

1868
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,100
She's dead.

1869
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:02,500
She ran into a trap and got arrested.

1870
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,160
GoldenEyes decided to make an example of her and scare the mob back into submission.

1871
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:13,740
She executed my mother in the marketplace using this very gun.

1872
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,460
They tried to lock me up on the orphanage,

1873
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:21,680
but I ran away.

1874
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:27,720
I knew how to get into the palace without getting caught so I took the gun and I swear

1875
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:33,140
if I had known that it needs bullets to work I would have killed GoldenEyes right there.

1876
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:34,840
But the gun only clicked.

1877
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:38,680
You lied to me.

1878
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:43,560
You lied to me and the people in Ferndale who took you in.

1879
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:45,160
You lied to everyone.

1880
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,700
You don't know how it is to grow up as a pig.

1881
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:49,920
Being powerless,

1882
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:50,700
helpless,

1883
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:52,980
wearing a smile like a mask.

1884
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:56,600
This weapon was the only power I ever had.

1885
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:58,900
Who gave you the bullets?

1886
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:01,660
The man who took us to the city did.

1887
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,940
You know him as Amberleafs.

1888
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,140
Everyone else knows him as Whisperwind.

1889
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:07,900
Whisperwind.

1890
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,760
The man who just married Lady GoldenEyes.

1891
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:12,760
But why?

1892
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:13,980
And why you?

1893
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,980
How did he even know we were coming?

1894
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,860
It makes no sense.

1895
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,260
He secretly works for the Institute.

1896
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:26,560
Ironforge is still a bastion of the opposition and GoldenEyes is the key to reclaiming it.

1897
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:32,060
Whisperwind married her because it makes him the legitimate ruler of Ironforge.

1898
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,780
But to remain in power he must remain free of even the slightest suspicion.

1899
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:40,720
The opposition has been searching for me since I ran away.

1900
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:46,380
And when Whisperwind heard that I was among the kidnapped students from Ferndale,

1901
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,520
he knew where to look for me.

1902
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,280
And he also knew that I was out for revenge.

1903
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,520
He made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

1904
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:00,840
Two bullets to make this a victory for my mother and for the Institute.

1905
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:01,480
No.

1906
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:03,800
No, he is not one of us.

1907
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,300
This would have been murder plain and simple.

1908
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,600
It would have been against all the

1909
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:12,360
principles the Institute stands for.

1910
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:16,820
If you had spent more than a day at our school you would know that.

1911
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:23,200
Whisperwind saw your blind hate for Lady GoldenEyes and abused you for his own selfish reasons.

1912
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:23,780
And no,

1913
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,620
he is on the good side.

1914
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,860
Your side.

1915
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:28,180
And so am I.

1916
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:29,240
No,

1917
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:30,400
no, Potami.

1918
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,640
Hate is never on the good side.

1919
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,520
You taught me how to make love.

1920
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,240
I wonder if you even know what love is.

1921
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:40,560
You pretended to be my friend.

1922
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:45,560
But in the end all that mattered to you was that I showed you how to work that fucking gun.

1923
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:46,360
Am I right?

1924
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,780
No, that is not true.

1925
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:49,160
And when you shot that lady,

1926
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,280
I was the one who took the bullets so you

1927
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,360
could get away.

1928
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:54,820
Right?

1929
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:55,480
No,

1930
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:56,380
no.

1931
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:58,640
Would you also...

1932
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,800
No, I even came back to save you.

1933
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:01,860
Yeah, right.

1934
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:04,380
And would you have come back if your plan had worked?

1935
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,520
Do you think I might still be useful for you after all?

1936
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:11,080
No, I did it because I love you.

1937
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:13,140
Save your breath, Potami.

1938
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,700
I am not going to play this game any longer.

1939
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,400
I have real friends to find in this city.

1940
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:20,160
No,

1941
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:21,160
no,

1942
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:22,440
please.

1943
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:23,340
Fuck.

1944
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:24,780
Rainy!

1945
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:26,980
I am okay.

1946
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,480
Everything is just peachy.

1947
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,120
Be safe.

1948
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:32,940
No,

1949
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,760
at least take the gun with you.

1950
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,500
I don't need a gun.

1951
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,120
Nobody needs a gun.

1952
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:47,040
I'm on the good side and I'm going to prove it.

1953
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:50,400
Whisperwind told me where to find him.

1954
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:55,800
We will free the students and find the kidnappers and put an end to all of this.

1955
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:03,200
And please,

1956
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:04,880
please be wrong.

1957
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:08,220
By the gods, please be wrong.

1958
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:22,560
Rocky! Hey, Rocky!

1959
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,200
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1960
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,080
Stop swearing on the job.

1961
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,260
You know, the gods are always listening.

1962
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,200
Which ones?

1963
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,340
The ones in the holy mountain that turned out not to exist?

1964
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,900
Or the other ones who let this shit happen?

1965
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,400
You're a hopeless case.

1966
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:39,140
Hope?

1967
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:43,080
I must have lost that motherfucker somewhere between all the dead bodies.

1968
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,800
Let me know if you find it.

1969
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:45,740
Anyway,

1970
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:47,500
meet your new volunteer,

1971
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:48,920
Honeyfoot of Ferndale.

1972
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,600
Hello, honey.

1973
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:51,300
Oh,

1974
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,420
please, don't call me honey.

1975
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,840
My friends call me foot.

1976
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,340
I hope you're going to last longer than the guy before you,

1977
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:58,600
honey.

1978
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,920
I shall do my best.

1979
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:00,840
And again,

1980
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:02,560
please call me foots,

1981
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,040
not honey.

1982
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:07,580
Look, honey, I've stopped counting how many helpers I had.

1983
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,780
I couldn't care less what your fucking name is,

1984
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,600
because tomorrow you'll be gone like everyone else.

1985
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:15,620
Listen, you weasel-headed cockwomble.

1986
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,180
I don't fucking care what your shit-ass problem is.

1987
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:20,740
If you don't want my help,

1988
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:23,320
you can go take a flying fuck at a rolling donut.

1989
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,560
You worthless, fucking cockspot.

1990
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:32,260
Oh, oh,

1991
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,300
you know what?

1992
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,060
I like you.

1993
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:38,920
I think I really like you.

1994
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:39,900
Finally,

1995
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,940
someone who's not made of glass.

1996
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,040
Hello, foots.

1997
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,200
Name's Rocky.

1998
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:46,800
Welcome to Camp Freedom,

1999
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,460
your worst nightmare.

2000
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,260
I have a strong stomach.

2001
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,100
Yeah, that's what they always say.

2002
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,000
Here, take one of these.

2003
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,380
Tie them around your head so it covers your muzzle.

2004
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,700
Ooooooh.

2005
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,340
Yeah, I know.

2006
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:02,980
Stings a bit in your nose,

2007
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,360
but you'll get used to it.

2008
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,660
It's nothing compared to the smell of the bodies.

2009
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,240
This used to be the headquarters of the Rebel Underground,

2010
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,240
until the Keepers found out about it.

2011
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:12,360
They came in the night,

2012
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,120
knocked everyone out with their magic shock rods,

2013
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,900
then set the place on fire.

2014
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,920
Most of the Rebels burned to a crisp.

2015
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,920
However, some did not.

2016
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:22,820
Judging from where the bodies are,

2017
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,480
some of them must have woken

2018
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,160
up trying to escape the flames.

2019
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:29,080
Their remains are scattered all around the place.

2020
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,320
Some have been eaten by the pig rats,

2021
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:33,800
and what's left of them is not pretty.

2022
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:36,240
And how do we go about cleaning this mess up?

2023
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:40,280
The other team brings the Rebels and all their belongings that made it through the fire and

2024
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:41,340
line them up over there.

2025
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:43,580
Then it's our job to identify them.

2026
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,160
If we find out who they

2027
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:48,540
are, we send them back to their families so they can be given a proper burial.

2028
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:51,820
Everyone else gets an anonymous grave right here.

2029
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:52,500
Okay,

2030
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,400
I told you I have a strong stomach,

2031
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:55,460
so let's get started.

2032
01:36:56,130 --> 01:36:56,580
Alright.

2033
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,180
Get one of the bags,

2034
01:36:58,260 --> 01:36:59,140
I'll show you what to do.

2035
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:07,420
Let's see who's in this one.

2036
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,480
Ooh, we're lucky.

2037
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,600
This one's pretty much in one piece.

2038
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:16,400
We must cut his clothes off and see if he's got anything on him that might tell

2039
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,000
us who he is.

2040
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,820
Documents, jewelry, anything.

2041
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:19,760
Gotcha.

2042
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:24,780
Hmm.

2043
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,060
Must have been a shirt.

2044
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,140
Well, the rest of him is charcoal.

2045
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,020
Oh,

2046
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:31,700
wait,

2047
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:33,020
he's wearing a ring.

2048
01:37:33,810 --> 01:37:34,260
Good.

2049
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:35,820
If it's a wedding ring,

2050
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:36,960
it might have an inscription.

2051
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,000
But how do we get it off?

2052
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,260
We don't.

2053
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:43,380
Yuck, the finger comes right off.

2054
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:45,480
And it's a wedding ring.

2055
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,040
Golden eyes and quicksilver.

2056
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:48,440
Oh,

2057
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:49,940
congratulations.

2058
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,520
Your first case is a celebrity.

2059
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:57,460
You mean this is Lord Quicksilver of Iron Forge?

2060
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:58,720
The one and only.

2061
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,620
So the rumors were true.

2062
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,700
He really did join the Rebellion.

2063
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:04,120
Ah, well,

2064
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:05,380
and now he's dead.

2065
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:07,220
I hope it was worth it.

2066
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:09,060
Yeah, I hope so too.

2067
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,100
As much as I disliked the Keepers,

2068
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,820
at least they kept the lands united.

2069
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:14,980
Now, who rules the rulers?

2070
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,000
It's a small wonder we're not at war with each other yet.

2071
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,960
Yeah, it's a very unstable situation.

2072
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,480
Oh, yes it is.

2073
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:24,040
Do you believe in gods?

2074
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:24,980
Nope.

2075
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,260
Neither do I.

2076
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,240
But I do believe in the good in man.

2077
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:32,160
So let's make sure the Lord gets back to Iron Forge where he belongs.

2078
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:50,400
Oh, excuse me, sir.

2079
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,000
What is it?

2080
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,980
I am looking for Longleaf's bakery.

2081
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,160
Longleaf, you say?

2082
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:57,520
Yeah.

2083
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,620
Why?

2084
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,440
Because, well, they say he makes the best sweet rolls on this side of Serpent River.

2085
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:08,660
I've come all the way from Coldlay to get some for my mother's birthday.

2086
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:13,140
Your story fills me with determination and hunger.

2087
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:14,840
But nope,

2088
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:15,480
sorry,

2089
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,280
never heard of anyone called Longleaf.

2090
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:18,400
However,

2091
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:19,740
if it's sweet rolls you want,

2092
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,740
try Sugar Tooth on Vine Street.

2093
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:24,380
His almond pastries are delicious.

2094
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:26,200
Ah, okay.

2095
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:27,100
Thank you, sir.

2096
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,120
Have a good day, sir.

2097
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:28,900
Take care.

2098
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:32,540
Man,

2099
01:39:33,620 --> 01:39:35,620
finding Longleaf can't be that hard.

2100
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,420
How many bakeries can there be in a town like this?

2101
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,820
Excuse me, sir.

2102
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:43,560
Hmm?

2103
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:46,440
I'm looking for someone called Longleaf.

2104
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:47,800
Hmm.

2105
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:51,340
He's supposed to be running a bakery here somewhere.

2106
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:52,400
Hmm.

2107
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,700
So you don't know him?

2108
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:56,760
Uh-uh.

2109
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:03,920
Oh, and he might be wearing a symbol like this one.

2110
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:06,440
Listen, you little mongrel! Uh-huh.

2111
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:09,460
We don't welcome rebel scum like you around here.

2112
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,820
Okay, okay, okay, easy, easy.

2113
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,420
This city belongs to us.

2114
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:12,980
Okay.

2115
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,420
If your friend ever lived here,

2116
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:18,720
we'd probably send him to hell where he belongs.

2117
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,360
Now bugger off!

2118
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,180
I'm just here for the sweet rolls,

2119
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:22,560
honestly.

2120
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,500
I don't want to cause any trouble.

2121
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:25,820
Have a nice day, sir.

2122
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,280
Holy shit, that was close.

2123
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,600
This is not the Ironforge that Ankur brushes books.

2124
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,580
No, no, no!

2125
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:44,000
Stop making a fuss already.

2126
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:45,640
I'm your friend.

2127
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:47,420
Longleaf!

2128
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,200
Thank the gods, I thought I'd never find you.

2129
01:40:56,610 --> 01:41:01,080
You have no idea what kind of huge and dangerous ruckus you have been making.

2130
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:01,660
What?

2131
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:02,880
I...

2132
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,540
There's so much I need to tell you.

2133
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:07,420
But let's go somewhere else first.

2134
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,360
How about your place?

2135
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,200
My place?

2136
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,480
After shooting the princess and asking bloody everyone for my name,

2137
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:17,340
while waving the bloody tree of knowledge in their face,

2138
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:20,100
there is now a bloody mob in front of my shop,

2139
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:21,160
smashing my windows.

2140
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:25,220
I hope you have a damn good reason for showing up like this.

2141
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:28,280
Look, you're the only one I know.

2142
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:33,120
Lady GoldenEye has had the entire class kidnapped from the school in Ferndale,

2143
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,440
but Putami and I managed to escape.

2144
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:39,540
I started looking for you the moment we arrived here,

2145
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,240
but then we...

2146
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:44,720
You decided to kill Lady GoldenEye first, in broad daylight!

2147
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,740
No, but Putami did it.

2148
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:48,760
I even tried to stop her.

2149
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:49,900
Oh,

2150
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:51,160
so it was her.

2151
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:53,300
You know her?

2152
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:54,440
Only know her mother.

2153
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:58,980
Without her, our presence here is down to nothing more than a couple of veterans.

2154
01:41:59,540 --> 01:41:59,680
Too

2155
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,180
bad you didn't go for Whisperwind instead.

2156
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:04,020
He is the one who deserves to be shot,

2157
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,320
not GoldenEye's.

2158
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:05,860
But...

2159
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:09,320
but Whisperwind managed to convince Putami that he is with the Institute.

2160
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:13,360
I'd have expected her to know more about the Institute than our codex.

2161
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:15,720
Well, what do you expect from a pig?

2162
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:17,700
Wow, stop right there.

2163
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:20,080
That's not how you talk about your girlfriend.

2164
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:21,680
She betrayed me.

2165
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:22,980
She is not my girlfriend.

2166
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,600
Rubbish, of course she is.

2167
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,260
What even thinks she rescued you first?

2168
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:28,420
Coincidence.

2169
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,060
And why do you think she took you with her all the way through Darkwoods?

2170
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:33,960
Because she knew she needed me.

2171
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:37,260
But she didn't need you anymore once you were here.

2172
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:41,060
I don't know and I don't care.

2173
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,180
Really?

2174
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,020
Then why didn't she leave you behind?

2175
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,560
I have no idea.

2176
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:51,520
Boy,

2177
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,080
you are in full on denial.

2178
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:54,820
She cares about you.

2179
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:55,660
A lot.

2180
01:42:56,180 --> 01:42:57,020
Don't you see that?

2181
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,600
Then why did she hurt me so much?

2182
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:01,980
Someone killed her mother.

2183
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,260
Imagine the pain she's gone through.

2184
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:07,500
When Whisperwind gave her the chance for revenge,

2185
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:11,260
that made her forget everything else and it clouded her mind with hate.

2186
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,420
Yes, it was wrong,

2187
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,400
but it can happen to any of us.

2188
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,420
Not to me.

2189
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:19,140
Well,

2190
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,300
let me guess who told her how to use the gun.

2191
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:24,000
It was you, right?

2192
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:25,320
Yeah,

2193
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:26,720
yes, it was me.

2194
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:28,020
Did she ask you for it?

2195
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:30,300
So the truth is,

2196
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:34,820
you wanted to impress your crush and your feelings made you blind to the consequences.

2197
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:39,900
Like, for example, that you were effectively teaching her how to shoot the lady.

2198
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:43,000
So don't ever again say it doesn't happen to you.

2199
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,640
It does all the time.

2200
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:48,940
So,

2201
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,480
you know where your girlfriend is now?

2202
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,160
She wanted to meet Whisperwind.

2203
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:59,020
He's an expert boyfriend that'll walk right into his trap.

2204
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,580
I was mad at her.

2205
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,860
That means she deserves to die or what?

2206
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,300
I'm such a bloody idiot, ain't I?

2207
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,940
For God's sake, I'm such an idiot.

2208
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:15,460
Does she still have the gun?

2209
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:16,520
Yeah.

2210
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:19,220
Let's hope she'll shoot the right guy this time.

2211
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:20,760
Stop being so goddamn cynical.

2212
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:21,720
Look,

2213
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:25,880
GoldenEyes doesn't want the public to know she kidnapped innocent students.

2214
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:30,580
And Whisperwind won't be too happy about witnesses to his conspiracy running around either.

2215
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:32,840
And on top of all of that,

2216
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:36,780
the public thinks you're the accomplices to an attempt at murder.

2217
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,480
The entire city is against us,

2218
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:40,220
literally.

2219
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:44,100
All we can do is get the news to Ferndale and hope for the best.

2220
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,760
I wonder what Riversong would have done.

2221
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:48,680
Your father.

2222
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:50,120
Why would that matter?

2223
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,260
Because he was a hero.

2224
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:56,160
He went out of his way to save my mother back during the rebellion.

2225
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,480
He's also dead.

2226
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,900
If it is my fate to die for a good cause,

2227
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,260
so be it.

2228
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,360
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

2229
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,160
I screwed up big time.

2230
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,060
I can't just sit here and wait.

2231
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,540
You're doing that emotional thing again.

2232
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,280
Just look at yourself.

2233
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,680
Your arm is still bleeding.

2234
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:18,640
You couldn't even hold a butter knife.

2235
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:19,940
You're crazy.

2236
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,760
Don't touch it.

2237
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:23,460
Better tell me where I can find Whisperwind.

2238
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,040
Well,

2239
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:28,700
how would I know?

2240
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,400
He's probably either at home or

2241
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,280
telling lies to his wife.

2242
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,040
Or he might be spending the night at one of his brothels.

2243
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,280
His brothels?

2244
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:38,060
You

2245
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:39,600
didn't know?

2246
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:45,760
The Cat House is probably the only business in Ironforge that still turns a solid profit.

2247
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:49,060
Extractions from misery are in high demand these days.

2248
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:53,040
They let the sleaziest guy in town marry the princess?

2249
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,920
All that matters is gold these days.

2250
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,840
And of that, he's got plenty.

2251
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:00,340
He's not going to meet Botami at the palace,

2252
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,100
so they must be at the Cat House.

2253
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,000
Maybe.

2254
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:04,280
But what are you going to do?

2255
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,240
I'll come up with something.

2256
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:08,160
You go to get help from Furnir,

2257
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,980
and I'll go save my girlfriend.

2258
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,280
Oh, now she's your girlfriend again.

2259
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:14,540
Well then, good luck.

2260
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:18,020
Oh, what kind of flowers would you like on your grave?

2261
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,820
White chrysanthemums for love,

2262
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,360
truth, and a long life.

2263
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,860
Oh, by the gods, grow up!

2264
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,780
Goodbye, Longleaf.

2265
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,340
No,

2266
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,680
you're making a mistake.

2267
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,420
The enemy's in the majority.

2268
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,620
I can't help you when...

2269
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:31,180
Goodbye.

2270
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:37,980
There he goes! He's the one! Let's get him!

2271
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,640
Fuck!

2272
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:41,140
Fuck! Fuck!

2273
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,440
Oh,

2274
01:46:58,340 --> 01:47:03,320
what a surprise! Lady visitors have become so rare these days.

2275
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,860
Welcome to the Cat House.

2276
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,280
My name is Snowflake.

2277
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,480
Is this your first visit here?

2278
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,860
Yes, but...

2279
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:17,340
There's no reason to be ashamed.

2280
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:20,720
This is the first time for everything.

2281
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:24,780
The Cat House proudly caters to all species,

2282
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:26,940
sexes, and preferences.

2283
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:28,580
So,

2284
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:29,920
tell me,

2285
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,920
are you into boys or into girls?

2286
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:34,660
Or maybe even both?

2287
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,880
Maybe even at the same time?

2288
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,380
Um,

2289
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:42,420
I'm actually here to see Lord Whisperwind.

2290
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,360
Oh,

2291
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,100
you're here for an audition.

2292
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,720
Why didn't you say so?

2293
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:49,060
Um,

2294
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,500
when was your appointment again?

2295
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,420
I don't have an appointment.

2296
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:56,360
I just want to talk to the Lord, if that's possible.

2297
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:57,920
My name is Potami.

2298
01:47:58,340 --> 01:47:58,880
He knows me.

2299
01:47:59,030 --> 01:48:01,260
That should be possible,

2300
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:02,100
but

2301
01:48:02,620 --> 01:48:04,060
it may take a while.

2302
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:07,800
The Lord is terribly busy at the moment.

2303
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:09,540
No problem.

2304
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:10,760
I'm not in a rush.

2305
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:16,580
I hope you realize that just talking is not going to get you a job here, right?

2306
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:19,220
I appreciate the advice,

2307
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,580
but I really just want to talk.

2308
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,200
All right, just saying.

2309
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:26,680
Can I fetch you something to drink?

2310
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,880
We have a whole new menu with original human recipes.

2311
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:32,820
Um, I don't know.

2312
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:34,420
What would you recommend?

2313
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,260
There's a hot drink called coffee.

2314
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,800
And let me tell you,

2315
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:44,760
that one really gets your juices flowing.

2316
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,160
Um, sounds nice.

2317
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,880
Perfect! I'll get you one!

2318
01:48:58,510 --> 01:49:00,840
Well, well, Whisperwind.

2319
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:01,920
So,

2320
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:04,380
how does it feel to be a Lord?

2321
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:07,620
Oh, it's the most glorious feeling in the world.

2322
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:10,400
Oh, even better than my pussy.

2323
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:15,180
Why compare when I can have both at the same time?

2324
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:17,760
You're such a naughty boy.

2325
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,800
Cheating on your lady on your wedding night?

2326
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:24,640
Getting rid of her turned out to be harder than I thought.

2327
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:27,000
But next time I come to see you,

2328
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,320
it won't be cheating anymore.

2329
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:29,480
I promise.

2330
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,260
You know that my lips are sealed.

2331
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,420
You can come in any time.

2332
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,220
I'm always up for a good fuck.

2333
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,260
How much time do you have?

2334
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:40,740
I've got all the time in the world.

2335
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:43,000
Let's take it nice and slow.

2336
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:43,800
Oh,

2337
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:45,640
Whisperwind,

2338
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:47,400
you son of a rat.

2339
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,540
You're going to pay for this.

2340
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,260
I swear.

2341
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:53,060
You are so going to pay for this.

2342
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,720
Here's your cup of coffee.

2343
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,460
Black and hot,

2344
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:00,280
just as it should be.

2345
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:00,780
Oh,

2346
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:01,820
thank you.

2347
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,920
I've never had coffee before.

2348
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,000
Try it.

2349
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:12,380
Good, isn't it?

2350
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:19,920
Snowy?

2351
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:20,640
Yeah?

2352
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:21,140
Hey,

2353
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:24,260
he wants the slow routine tonight.

2354
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,320
Can you get me the cuffs and the blindfold?

2355
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:28,540
Sure thing.

2356
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:41,420
Here you are.

2357
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,260
Thanks.

2358
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:45,880
Now,

2359
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,720
it looks like this is going to take a while.

2360
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,120
Are you sure you want to continue waiting?

2361
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,980
Well, it's not as if I had a choice.

2362
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,520
Oh, well, your decision.

2363
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:58,900
Enjoy your coffee.

2364
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:00,640
Thank you.

2365
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,900
Wait,

2366
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,080
Snowflake.

2367
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:06,020
Yes?

2368
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:07,240
Ah,

2369
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:08,420
you're right.

2370
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:11,700
Just talking isn't going to impress the Lord.

2371
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:16,540
So I thought maybe you could tell me a little bit about him.

2372
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:19,420
Like the stuff that really rocks his boat,

2373
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:20,780
if you know what I mean.

2374
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:22,720
If you want to,

2375
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,140
I could ask Moonshine if she'd be up for a little chat later.

2376
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:28,180
She's the Lord's favorite,

2377
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,100
and she knows everything about him.

2378
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,280
Can you come back tomorrow?

2379
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:35,780
No,

2380
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:37,600
I only have time today.

2381
01:51:38,620 --> 01:51:41,680
But maybe you could ask her,

2382
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,060
like,

2383
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:46,580
maybe she would let me watch?

2384
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,460
I like how you think.

2385
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,920
Well, you're in training already.

2386
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:54,820
You're such a kinky little pig.

2387
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,120
Oh,

2388
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:56,800
sorry.

2389
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:57,920
No offense.

2390
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,440
Just let me talk to Moonshine.

2391
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:06,440
Hey,

2392
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:07,560
Moonshine.

2393
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:08,260
Yeah?

2394
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:09,140
What is it?

2395
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,540
The young girl over there.

2396
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:14,200
She was wondering if you'd let her watch, maybe?

2397
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:15,560
Yes.

2398
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,020
Really?

2399
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:17,880
Great.

2400
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:18,360
Why not?

2401
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,340
Okay,

2402
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,380
Moony is fine with it.

2403
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:27,720
But you have to stay absolutely still.

2404
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:29,860
If the Lord finds out,

2405
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:32,680
we're going to lose more than just our jobs.

2406
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:33,400
Get it?

2407
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:47,480
Yes!

2408
01:52:51,200 --> 01:53:03,340
Oh

2409
01:53:04,170 --> 01:53:05,220
Yes,

2410
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,560
your paws are magic take your time ladies take your time

2411
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:15,760
You can't imagine what an exhausting day I have

2412
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:17,380
weddings

2413
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:18,940
assassinations

2414
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:21,800
Yes, go on like that.

2415
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:25,440
Yeah right there so soft

2416
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:39,180
Whisper wind whisper

2417
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,840
Oh, well so much for the long routine

2418
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:49,640
Wow, that's the first time I've seen you fall asleep with a pair of tits on his face

2419
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:54,360
He must be very tired shall we wake him up again?

2420
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:54,980
No,

2421
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:55,580
please.

2422
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:55,900
No,

2423
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:59,100
I'm glad that I don't have to listen through another night of confessions

2424
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:01,720
You should write a biography

2425
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:09,360
I totally could and I could swear it turns him on it's like his personal way of talking dirty

2426
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:11,320
What a strange guy.

2427
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,280
Oh, that's at least untie him.

2428
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:13,880
Okay

2429
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:38,260
I'm sorry little one that usually plays out a bit differently.

2430
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,360
Oh, well

2431
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:40,560
Thank you.

2432
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,020
Anyway

2433
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,500
You did your best.

2434
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,300
Oh the only way to survive in this job.

2435
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:46,240
See you later

2436
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,740
I'm afraid you won't get your audition today little one.

2437
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,320
Oh Yeah, it looks like it

2438
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:04,220
too bad you can't come back tomorrow

2439
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,420
You're remarkably sexy for a pig.

2440
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:08,220
Oh

2441
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,260
Thank you.

2442
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:12,080
That was almost not racist

2443
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:24,480
Okay,

2444
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,520
it's time for me to leave then

2445
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:29,420
Thank you for the coffee and the demo

2446
01:55:30,130 --> 01:55:31,600
I've learned a lot today.

2447
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:35,300
Have a good night toodles

2448
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:53,260
Business seems to be slow today.

2449
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:54,620
Excellent.

2450
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:57,700
Now just you wait whisper

2451
01:56:33,230 --> 01:56:34,180
I

2452
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:38,000
think I'm going to keep those clothes

2453
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:43,200
Rain dancers going to have a stroke if he sees me like that

2454
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:26,580
I just

2455
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,500
fall asleep

2456
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:32,540
Damn that never happened to me before

2457
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:35,900
Are you still oh,

2458
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:38,860
oh, oh, yes you are

2459
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:41,480
Yeah, yeah

2460
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:44,100
Moonshine you are the best.

2461
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:46,480
Oh, that's stupid pig

2462
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:51,260
fights to shoot gold mice at arm length Oh God, yes

2463
01:57:52,090 --> 01:57:55,220
Then the other guy takes her down and

2464
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:57,580
bursts my busts my plan

2465
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:04,240
Faster moonshine faster You know that bitch was

2466
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:07,300
one of the bloody hostages from Ferndale

2467
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:10,660
Turns out she is the bloody daughter of that spy.

2468
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,520
We killed a couple of weeks ago.

2469
01:58:12,570 --> 01:58:15,900
Oh Yeah Yes

2470
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:21,260
Told her I am with the Institute told her everything she wanted to hear

2471
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:26,160
Stupid little pig was so hell-bent on revenge.

2472
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:28,480
I didn't even have to pay her

2473
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:33,200
Faster

2474
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:34,720
faster.

2475
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:40,200
Yeah, the irony is it was me who made the lady kill her mother

2476
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,400
It was not me all along

2477
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:51,980
Careful with your teeth, huh?

2478
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,580
You know, I like it rough.

2479
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:55,240
Don't you?

2480
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:09,920
You're going to love what comes next What the fuck

2481
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:10,940
You

2482
01:59:13,310 --> 01:59:16,040
Right iron forge

2483
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,760
and you betrayed gold not you betrayed me

2484
01:59:21,620 --> 01:59:24,320
Because you wanted the throne and you wanted it alone

2485
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:33,620
No matter what you do

2486
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:37,400
Neither will your best friend from Ferdinand

2487
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,720
I can help it

2488
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:47,940
Is that all you got come on kill me kill me do it push harder harder

2489
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:55,900
No, I Know you couldn't do it

2490
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,080
in the end.

2491
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:59,300
You're just a dirty little pig

2492
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:02,980
What did you just say?

2493
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:03,400
Yeah

2494
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:05,680
Dirty

2495
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:12,120
Pig nobody calls me

2496
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:16,720
Maybe

2497
02:00:31,250 --> 02:00:33,360
you do deserve to die

2498
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,640
but enough blood has been spilled.

2499
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:43,900
I Need to put things right and I really don't want to leave the nice ladies without that body in their bedroom

2500
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:56,440
Who taught me oh

2501
02:00:56,980 --> 02:00:58,060
What the fuck happened here?

2502
02:00:58,940 --> 02:00:59,360
Oh

2503
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:02,840
I Got my audition after all

2504
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:04,160
much

2505
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:07,820
The Lord just had the right of his life.

2506
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,300
He needs to rest

2507
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:11,800
See you

2508
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:35,420
Wow just All right May I have your attention, please?

2509
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:42,720
I would like to bring out a toast may all human knowledge be free and may iron forge become great again

2510
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:46,360
to the opposition and our allies Cheers

2511
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:54,920
All right whisper wind now you got to share the story what made this such a good day for us

2512
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:57,480
Where are you not at the execution this afternoon?

2513
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:00,520
Some of us still have to work to earn a living, you know

2514
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:05,140
Fair enough fair enough with today's execution.

2515
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:07,400
We killed two birds with one stone.

2516
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,440
I thought she was a pig Yes

2517
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:11,440
Yes,

2518
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:15,440
and she was the most important informant for the Institute in this town.

2519
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:18,520
They are now officially deaf and blind

2520
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:23,760
But what is even more remarkable

2521
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:28,140
I got the lady to do the deed herself in person

2522
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:29,740
Haha,

2523
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:35,020
I have finally managed to convince her that the gun is the only thing that keeps her in power

2524
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:42,320
She is all in I just started a little operation that will hit the leaders of the Institute where it hurts the most

2525
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:44,080
I can't tell you the details

2526
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:49,880
But these guys are so deeply ingrained in their own ideals about peace and pacifism

2527
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,280
They don't even have guards on their city walls.

2528
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:57,460
You could just walk in and then do whatever you want like let's say

2529
02:02:58,020 --> 02:03:02,500
Kidnap their children and then walk out again and nothing's gonna stop you.

2530
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:03,620
Can you believe that?

2531
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:12,400
That means we will soon have exclusive access to the blueprints to create our own human weapons

2532
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:14,400
The forge is fired up

2533
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:20,440
Just a few days I will be the lord of iron forge

2534
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:22,120
with our new weapons

2535
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:25,440
We will be the superior power of all the lands.

2536
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,260
We will crush the Institute

2537
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:32,780
We will conquer the holy mountain and we will unite the lands under our rule ship

2538
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,520
And this my friends

2539
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:38,480
this city will be the new capital of the world

2540
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:42,140
The opposition will make iron forge great again

2541
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,280
Dear mom,

2542
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:11,520
i'm sorry, you couldn't make it to our wedding on such short notice,

2543
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:12,440
but I hope that

2544
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:19,580
Screw it.

2545
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:22,720
I'm not sorry and she knows it

2546
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:27,420
Dear mom,

2547
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:30,780
I am so glad you were not at my wedding today

2548
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:33,840
Because someone almost killed me

2549
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:36,180
No,

2550
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,980
it's going to scare her to death

2551
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:44,720
Dear mom,

2552
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:46,980
I wish you were here right now

2553
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:52,100
Because this is my wedding night and my blood in your husband is not

2554
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:59,780
No, no, no, no, no, no No Too honest

2555
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,540
way too honest

2556
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:02,820
Damn,

2557
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:04,440
why is this so hard?

2558
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:15,440
Hello princess

2559
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,320
My god

2560
02:05:21,530 --> 02:05:23,760
Please not so loud.

2561
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:28,360
We're in enough trouble as it is and yelling will just make it worse

2562
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:31,500
Are you going to kill me now

2563
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:36,320
In cold blood like you killed my mother

2564
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:38,260
Oh

2565
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,580
That wasn't cold-blooded

2566
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:42,000
Believe me

2567
02:05:42,820 --> 02:05:45,500
It was the worst thing I ever did in my life

2568
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:49,540
They told me I had to give the people a taste of my power

2569
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:52,040
I didn't want to but

2570
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:53,480
they insisted

2571
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:58,060
I drank myself senseless until I thought I was ready to do it

2572
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:00,140
I had the gun

2573
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:03,420
I thought it would be easy just

2574
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:06,800
Pull the trigger and be done with it

2575
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:10,140
But it wasn't that easy

2576
02:06:11,620 --> 02:06:12,240
Not at all

2577
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:18,260
You can't imagine how much time I've spent waiting for this chance

2578
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,520
So many sleepless nights filled with thoughts about killing you

2579
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:24,380
But you know what?

2580
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:29,960
I changed my mind

2581
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:32,360
Here

2582
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,060
Take the gun

2583
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:37,420
I don't want it anymore

2584
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:43,100
Does it mean you forgive me

2585
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:44,260
No

2586
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:47,740
I will never able to forgive you

2587
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:50,900
But hate is a treacherous guide

2588
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:53,040
It turns you into a beast

2589
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:58,940
Sweet revenge dangling in front of you like a carrot held by whoever rides your back

2590
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:01,820
If you didn't come for revenge

2591
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:04,000
Why are you here?

2592
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:06,840
To make right what I did wrong

2593
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:10,240
To save many lives including your own

2594
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,220
And to save Ironforge, my home

2595
02:07:13,730 --> 02:07:16,480
And if you just have a shred of good left in you

2596
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:18,080
You will help me

2597
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:20,400
You're very brave

2598
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:22,620
And well-spoken

2599
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:27,760
Yeah, I practiced my speech the entire way from the cat house

2600
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:29,680
The cat house?

2601
02:07:29,740 --> 02:07:31,040
Oh yeah, the cat house

2602
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,780
Whisperwind is not on your side

2603
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:36,920
It was him who gave me the bullets to shoot you

2604
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:39,220
He knew that I was ready to do it

2605
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:42,500
We have a common enemy were his exact words

2606
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,320
That can't be true

2607
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,100
I swear it is

2608
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:52,520
From the very beginning he was planning to get rid of you as soon as he's the new lord of Ironforge

2609
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:54,560
But it didn't work out

2610
02:07:54,880 --> 02:08:02,180
And he is on his way right here right now to personally make sure that his face will be the last thing you will ever see

2611
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:05,380
And how are you supposed to know about all this

2612
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:10,440
Because I was there when he confessed it to his favorite whore

2613
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:11,900
You're lying!

2614
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:15,360
My lady! My lady!

2615
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:19,160
The lord just ordered the officer of the guard to take you in custody

2616
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:24,060
I locked all the doors but that's not going to stop them for long

2617
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:26,420
You must flee while you still can

2618
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:30,260
And how on earth did you get in here?

2619
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:36,040
This building has more holes in it than a piece of cold lake cheese and my mother knew them all

2620
02:08:38,330 --> 02:08:40,560
Whisperwind, you son of a whore

2621
02:08:42,410 --> 02:08:43,960
I've never trusted him

2622
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:50,020
And I wish I had listened to you earlier Is there anyone else left on our side?

2623
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:51,520
Unlikely,

2624
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:55,660
he is the lord now No one will dare to disobey him

2625
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:59,480
That means we're lost No, we are not

2626
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,980
There are still a few friends around who will fight with us And you are going to lead us there

2627
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,480
Me?

2628
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:08,360
How?

2629
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:10,320
Shhh!

2630
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:12,420
He can hear us

2631
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:13,960
Golden eyes,

2632
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:15,300
are you in there?

2633
02:09:15,820 --> 02:09:16,700
Open the door!

2634
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:18,520
Okay,

2635
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:21,940
now this is my plan Golden eyes

2636
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:23,260
We will go there and I will not...

2637
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:24,340
Who else is in there with you?

2638
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:25,920
Open the door!

2639
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:27,820
This is an order!

2640
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:36,020
This is a great plan!

2641
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:39,600
I'll stay here and put Whisperwind on the right track

2642
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:43,740
But this will be your end! You know you don't have to do this

2643
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:44,920
Maybe,

2644
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:49,700
but I'm not a small field I am a green field,

2645
02:09:49,820 --> 02:09:52,340
my lady My decision stands

2646
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:54,300
Green field,

2647
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:58,380
you're the most honorable man I have ever met

2648
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:02,320
I will make sure your name will always be remembered

2649
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:05,100
Stop talking and follow me, okay?

2650
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:06,000
Alright

2651
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:09,940
Alright,

2652
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:12,340
you wanted it this way!

2653
02:10:26,070 --> 02:10:27,920
Light

2654
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:29,900
so bright,

2655
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:33,340
light so pure

2656
02:10:34,090 --> 02:10:37,620
Keepers of the light,

2657
02:10:38,140 --> 02:10:41,260
answer me true Oh, for the last time,

2658
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:43,600
stop singing that song!

2659
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:45,860
I have to do something to keep me sane!

2660
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,720
Right now you're the one who drives me insane!

2661
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:54,160
Guys, stop yelling at each other! All we can do right now is be patient and wait for help

2662
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:55,300
You mean pray for help?

2663
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:59,960
Rubbish! Professor Bottlebrush will do everything he can to get us out of here

2664
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:02,740
He will come! If he ever finds us

2665
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:08,220
Should be a breeze with all his human science and weapons and gadgets and stuff,

2666
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:08,920
right?

2667
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:10,660
Then what is taking him so long?

2668
02:11:11,190 --> 02:11:12,640
Ironforge is a big city

2669
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:16,380
Do you really think he would use human weapons to rescue us?

2670
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:19,260
Wouldn't that be totally against his ideals?

2671
02:11:19,660 --> 02:11:20,580
Not only that,

2672
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:23,820
couldn't that be exactly what the opposition wants?

2673
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:25,580
There's no point in speculating

2674
02:11:25,780 --> 02:11:27,320
What else should this be about?

2675
02:11:27,740 --> 02:11:30,160
The opposition is not exactly short on gold,

2676
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:31,320
that's for sure

2677
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:34,440
I wonder who of us they're going to kill first?

2678
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,180
Shut your fucking piehole!

2679
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:38,680
I'm just stating the inevitable

2680
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:41,400
You can keep the inevitable to yourself!

2681
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,340
I hope Braindancer made it back to Ferndale

2682
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:46,480
Braindancer?

2683
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:55,220
No way he's gonna survive the dark woods on his own He hides under his bed every time there's a thunderstorm I've seen it Then what about the pig?

2684
02:11:55,660 --> 02:11:57,880
She's a red river hog if you please Well,

2685
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:02,000
pigs are tough She could have made it Why would she help us?

2686
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:06,400
She did not make a single move to rescue us when she had the chance Yeah,

2687
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:08,860
bloody pig! We're doomed

2688
02:12:09,380 --> 02:12:12,840
I give up Feel as gloomy as you like This is a free prison

2689
02:12:12,860 --> 02:12:17,780
after all Light so bright Run not again!

2690
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:20,220
Light so pure Wait,

2691
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,440
did you hear that?

2692
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:24,520
If

2693
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:27,900
it's one of the Morans from the wagon,

2694
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:32,660
we might be able to overwhelm him Do you think we can work together just this one time?

2695
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:34,560
You guys go over there,

2696
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:35,940
and you guys go over

2697
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:37,360
there And on my command,

2698
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:41,240
we all jump If he's stupid enough to come in here anyway Ouch!

2699
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:41,920
Shh!

2700
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,560
One...

2701
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:46,520
Two...

2702
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,520
Stop! Don't jump! What the hell?

2703
02:13:10,030 --> 02:13:11,560
Ah, that's it!

2704
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:13,800
Everything is in place

2705
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:18,320
Now all we have to do is wait for Whisperwind to show up and spring the trap

2706
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:21,460
I can't wait to make him pay for what he has done

2707
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:23,420
If he shows up at all

2708
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:26,380
Greenfield told them where to find us

2709
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:28,900
He's way too proud not to show up

2710
02:13:29,650 --> 02:13:33,440
Well, but he will have a small army in town very likely

2711
02:13:33,990 --> 02:13:37,500
We can only hope they are still more loyal to you than him

2712
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:40,460
His power hangs by a thread

2713
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,620
People obey him to keep their heads on their shoulders

2714
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:45,380
And that's it

2715
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,920
If we manage to take him out,

2716
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:49,900
they will be on my side,

2717
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:53,140
not his Let's hope so, by the gods

2718
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:58,100
I still don't know how you could fall for a guy like Whisperwind

2719
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:01,460
Well, you fell for him too, didn't you?

2720
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:02,740
Touche

2721
02:14:03,410 --> 02:14:07,580
He knows precisely how to use your fears against you

2722
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:09,700
What were you afraid of?

2723
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:15,760
Losing Ironforge When Quicksilver died, I was suddenly very lonely

2724
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:21,000
And all I knew about ruling a city was what I had overheard at dinner parties

2725
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:27,020
Whisperwind was both an experienced leader and an experienced lover

2726
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:29,540
He was exactly what I needed

2727
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:33,520
Also, I thought...

2728
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:35,040
What was the kidnapping about?

2729
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:40,360
The most important leaders of the Institute live in Ferndale

2730
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:44,120
And Whisperwind was mostly interested in weapons

2731
02:14:44,140 --> 02:14:50,020
Being able to make our own guns would have made us the most powerful city in the world

2732
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:55,180
So, we tried to blackmail Ferndale into giving us access to the library

2733
02:14:55,410 --> 02:14:58,840
And people say pigs are into dirty business

2734
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:01,900
I feel nothing but shame right now

2735
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:05,060
If I could turn back time,

2736
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:08,280
I would Oh, shh! I think they are coming

2737
02:15:17,290 --> 02:15:24,060
Golden Eyes, I know you are here Come out and show yourself

2738
02:15:24,430 --> 02:15:25,920
Shall I give the signal?

2739
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:26,520
No,

2740
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:27,380
not yet,

2741
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:28,840
they are too far away

2742
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:30,880
There's no point in hiding

2743
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,120
Your friendly butler sang like a little bird

2744
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:37,220
Come closer so we can talk

2745
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:41,020
Oh, is that the little piggy speaking?

2746
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:43,940
But I can hear you perfectly from over here

2747
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:46,040
I want Golden Eyes

2748
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:49,960
Send her out now and nobody gets hurt Shit,

2749
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:50,960
what now?

2750
02:15:51,380 --> 02:15:51,760
Shh,

2751
02:15:52,070 --> 02:15:54,440
patience If he wants to get us,

2752
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:56,060
he will have to move closer

2753
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:58,140
And then we will get him

2754
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:00,360
Golden Eyes is not here

2755
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:02,360
If you want to know where she is,

2756
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:04,300
come over here and we will talk

2757
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:06,580
Of course she's here

2758
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:09,460
Come out now, this is my final warning

2759
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:12,060
The final warning and then what?

2760
02:16:12,380 --> 02:16:14,240
The final warning...

2761
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:15,760
Before I kill your boyfriend

2762
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:20,760
Fuck! No! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! What is it?

2763
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:22,240
He's got Rain Dancer

2764
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:25,180
The man who saved your life Oh,

2765
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:28,720
fuck, for fuck's sake, why didn't I see this coming?

2766
02:16:29,420 --> 02:16:31,920
Oh, stupid pig, stupid pig, stupid pig

2767
02:16:32,300 --> 02:16:32,760
Okay,

2768
02:16:33,180 --> 02:16:35,020
let's put an end to all this

2769
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:38,540
I'm going out there right now Shh, no!

2770
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:42,000
I still have an axe to grind with this guy

2771
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:44,640
You can still surrender when I am dead

2772
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:45,980
Now hide,

2773
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:48,120
I don't want him to see you

2774
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:52,160
And don't give the signal until I tell you, okay?

2775
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:53,240
Okay

2776
02:17:01,810 --> 02:17:03,380
I'm so sorry,

2777
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:07,580
I just want to help you I love you,

2778
02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:10,200
Potami I know Now shut up

2779
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:13,780
So,

2780
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:16,380
you want to play rough, Whisperwind?

2781
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:18,640
I can play rough too

2782
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:24,920
One false move and you're dead Now let him go

2783
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:32,500
Oh, you stupid little piggy But this is not going to work

2784
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:38,200
Don't push me! I know that you don't have any bullets left I gave you two and you wasted them both

2785
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:40,640
You're forgetting about GoldenEye,

2786
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:43,400
Stache You mean this one?

2787
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:44,600
Oh, fuck!

2788
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:49,620
And now you're going to hand me the gun

2789
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:55,960
I said hand me the gun,

2790
02:17:56,140 --> 02:17:57,380
not drop the gun

2791
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,060
How long is this going to take?

2792
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,240
Okay,

2793
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,020
alright,

2794
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:13,560
here is your goddamn gun I hope you will kill yourself with it

2795
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:18,120
Just why do pigs have to get mad on everything?

2796
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:21,760
But anyways...

2797
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:27,720
I think it's time to end this story Farewell, little piggy

2798
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:31,200
My eyes!

2799
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:33,500
GoldenEye, no!

2800
02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:49,000
My eyes! I can't see!

2801
02:18:51,330 --> 02:18:54,580
In case you don't know the feeling,

2802
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:58,020
this is a sword against your throat

2803
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:01,120
So,

2804
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:03,240
what are you going to do?

2805
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:04,680
Kill me?

2806
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:07,220
I am the Lord of Ironforge!

2807
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:08,060
No,

2808
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:10,000
you are not!

2809
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,220
You are a criminal,

2810
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:14,180
a trickster,

2811
02:19:14,860 --> 02:19:15,660
a murderer

2812
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:22,800
You are nothing without me The people of Ironforge will never accept a woman as their leader,

2813
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:23,600
never!

2814
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:34,180
I'm not one of your ally cats My family has been ruling this city for many generations and we never betray our own people!

2815
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:35,240
So,

2816
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:37,740
who do you think they are going to obey?

2817
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,160
Me or you?

2818
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:41,800
Well,

2819
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:43,660
let's find out,

2820
02:19:44,060 --> 02:19:44,880
shall we?

2821
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:49,300
Let the soldiers go!

2822
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:54,220
Now,

2823
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,540
give them back their weapons!

2824
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:02,400
So,

2825
02:20:02,700 --> 02:20:03,620
my lord,

2826
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:05,960
what would you like them to do?

2827
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:09,900
GoldenEye is guilty of assault,

2828
02:20:11,020 --> 02:20:13,420
unlawful detention and high treason

2829
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:15,540
Arrest her!

2830
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:18,920
I said arrest her!

2831
02:20:22,110 --> 02:20:23,360
Soldiers,

2832
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:33,320
this man coerced me into marriage under false pretence which is therefore invalid Furthermore,

2833
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:45,440
I accuse him of attempted murder of a serene and conspiracy against the House of Ironforge He shall be tried in a court of law Arrest him!

2834
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:47,900
No!

2835
02:20:49,460 --> 02:20:50,060
No!

2836
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:54,040
Let me go! She has no right to issue commands!

2837
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:58,900
I am your lord! I am the ruler of Ironforge! You can't arrest me!

2838
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:00,160
No!

2839
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:11,260
Oh,

2840
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:13,200
Douglas

2841
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:17,100
I thought...

2842
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:19,280
I thought I was going to die

2843
02:21:19,540 --> 02:21:20,860
Oh, shh, don't worry.

2844
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:23,620
The little piggy is back to take care of you

2845
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:29,960
I thought I could be a hero like my father I couldn't

2846
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:32,140
I'm such a failure

2847
02:21:32,220 --> 02:21:35,180
You don't deserve a fool like me Shh!

2848
02:21:35,940 --> 02:21:37,640
Stop talking like that!

2849
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:43,580
Without you, we would all be dead right now How so?

2850
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:49,880
I stuck the barrel into the dirt as deep as I could before I gave it to Whisperwind

2851
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:52,440
And it went bang right in his ugly face

2852
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:54,920
You taught me that

2853
02:21:57,560 --> 02:21:59,880
I love you, Tami

2854
02:22:00,260 --> 02:22:01,160
I love you too

2855
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:05,340
Shut up!

2856
02:22:09,220 --> 02:22:10,040
Poor Tami,

2857
02:22:10,460 --> 02:22:12,160
I am forever in your debt

2858
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:13,500
My kingdom,

2859
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,300
my gold, my life

2860
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:17,420
Whatever it is you want,

2861
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:19,240
it is yours Thank

2862
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:20,560
you,

2863
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:24,880
but all I've ever needed is here in my arms right now

2864
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:31,140
And I was wrong about you You are a much more honorable person than I thought

2865
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:34,260
I can't bring myself to hate you anymore

2866
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:35,480
Go,

2867
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:37,240
your city needs you

2868
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:41,500
And you told me you're bad at politics

2869
02:22:42,740 --> 02:22:44,820
Truth lies beneath the mud,

2870
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:45,440
ancient pig wisdom

2871
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:50,720
Thank you And to you as well, raindancer

2872
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:54,740
Please let the Institute know that I deeply regret what I have done

2873
02:22:54,740 --> 02:22:58,580
And that I offer myself to be tried in an independent court

2874
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:03,420
And pay any kind of compensation they desire I will

2875
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:07,220
But can I make a suggestion?

2876
02:23:07,940 --> 02:23:08,920
Of course!

2877
02:23:09,980 --> 02:23:12,980
The Institute and the opposition know so little about each other

2878
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:14,980
Instead of building walls,

2879
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:17,820
we should open our gates And instead of spying,

2880
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:19,300
we should teach

2881
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:26,200
We have so much to learn The Institute needs to have an official representation in this city again

2882
02:23:26,900 --> 02:23:28,740
Consider it done Well,

2883
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:31,540
if you really want to spread your knowledge fast,

2884
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:34,080
just tell it to a sex worker of your choice

2885
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,140
But poor Tami, that

2886
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,480
was so inappropriate

2887
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:42,820
The truth beneath the mud, ancient pig wisdom

2888
02:23:43,790 --> 02:23:45,920
And my lady,

2889
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:51,040
don't you have a lot of really important official state business to do?

2890
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:52,960
Yes, but...

2891
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:53,200
And what?

2892
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:57,740
Oh, the sweet air of spring Whoa whoa whoa,

2893
02:23:58,260 --> 02:23:59,400
what are you trying to get at?

2894
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:04,180
You Wait What?

2895
02:24:04,620 --> 02:24:08,120
Oh, I'm talking about private lessons

2896
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:09,380
What lessons?

2897
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:10,340
What kind of lessons?

2898
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:15,140
Oh, by the gods! I want to screw your brains out right now!

2899
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:16,820
No!

2900
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:24,320
Are you crazy?

2901
02:24:25,630 --> 02:24:28,840
The princess of Ironforge is standing right next to us!

2902
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:32,980
My my my! Look at the time!

2903
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:38,340
I totally forgot I had lots of really important official speeches to do!

2904
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:44,760
Come on! I can't do this with all of them looking!

2905
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:46,840
Help!

2906
02:24:58,010 --> 02:25:02,020
Oh well! That's not going to be a problem!

2907
02:25:02,380 --> 02:25:02,580
What?

2908
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:04,580
Lights out!

2909
02:25:07,060 --> 02:25:13,240
So tasty!

2910
02:26:03,140 --> 02:26:12,180
Open your eyes and here you'll see it all

2911
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:16,840
Where shattered shadows always fall

2912
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:25,840
Raise up your ears and now you'll hear my will

2913
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:28,440
Righteous thunder,

2914
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,260
light-filled wonder,

2915
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:33,180
let their aura still

2916
02:26:34,860 --> 02:26:36,240
Give them my path,

2917
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:37,540
I'll go through them

2918
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,900
Hold deep my hand, guide me right

2919
02:26:41,630 --> 02:26:45,060
Bold and high so they can't see the night

2920
02:28:23,320 --> 02:28:26,240
Give them my path,

2921
02:28:26,300 --> 02:28:31,240
I'll go through them Hold deep my hand, guide me right

2922
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:35,120
Bold and high so they can't see their last

2923
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:37,900
light

2924
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:44,840
Faster than sound, I long to them With all the pull you're divine

2925
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:52,980
Bold and high, you'll be forever, ever, ever mine

2926
02:28:54,980 --> 02:29:00,800
Bold and high, yeah!
