1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,680
Long before our time,

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,800
the Earth was ruled by humans.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,800
They could fly to the moon and
lived in cities the size of kingdoms.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
But for all their great achievements,

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,920
they also built the most terrible weapons.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,560
When the Great War broke out,

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,280
it wiped their civilization
from the face of the Earth

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,160
in a matter of days,

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,760
and only a few survived in
shelters deep underground.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,360
Unable to return to the surface,

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,800
the humans decided
to create a new kind of

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,720
creature to rebuild the
world they had destroyed.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,520
These creatures were just enough of a human
to understand their master's commands,

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,440
but also enough of an animal
to be denied their freedom.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,920
The humans discovered

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,360
much too late that they had not
created an army of willing slaves,

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,200
but rather a new people whose intelligence,

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,640
curiosity, and desire to live free
was just as strong as their own.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,440
The revolution was swift and cruel,

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
and this time,

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,400
no humans survived.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,080
The leaders of the uprising called
themselves Keepers of the Light,

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,240
and their mastery of

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,080
human technology gave
them godlike powers.

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,560
The common folks
worshipped them like saints

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,480
and simply accepted
them as their new rulers,

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
for this was all they knew.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,640
Generations passed,

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,680
and the memories of the
uprising faded into legend,

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,080
and from legend into myth.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,480
Common folks as well as people among
their own ranks became increasingly wary,

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,480
until,

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,280
in the year 385,

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,520
a terrible bloodbath finally
ended the Keepers' reign.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,640
It was us,

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,960
the rebel underground,

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,680
who finally put an end
to the Keepers' tyranny,

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,040
and ever since it has
been our mission to give the

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,720
Keepers' legacy of human
knowledge back to whom it belongs.

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
You,

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,560
the true descendants of humankind.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,640
This is why you are here,

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,840
at the Institute of Science,
History, and Morality,

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,280
and I would like to wholeheartedly
welcome all of our new students who have

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,600
joined us today here in Ferndale for
the beginning of the new semester.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,560
Same old speech.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah,

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,240
I've heard the professor say this so many
times I can almost repeat it word for word.

49
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,015
Well,

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,840
if you two already know it so well,

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm sure you know what this
symbol here on the wall means.

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,160
It's the tree of knowledge,

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,000
and it means, well,
it's a tree and it grows,

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
just like knowledge.

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,560
It used to be the secret
symbol of the rebel underground,

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,040
but it stands for more than just knowledge.

57
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,640
It also stands for the
ideals of a new society,

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,000
peace, progress, and freedom.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,480
And who were the heroes who
gave their lives for that freedom, huh?

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,960
You over there.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,800
Um,

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,280
let me think.

63
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,280
I

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,960
Think it was Black
something and the other guy.

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
See?

66
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,200
That's what you get
for talking all the time.

67
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,520
Does anybody else know?

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Raindancer,

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
how about you?

70
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:37,880
Why always me?

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
Okay.

72
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,560
The three great dead
people of the Rebellion.

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,360
Brother Fireheart of Coldlake,

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,440
founding father of the Rebellion,

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,920
executed by the Keepers of the Light.

76
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,680
Stormrunner of Camp Freedom,

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,960
who died in the heroic
fight over the Holy Mountain.

78
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
And Riversong of Ferndale,

79
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,880
who infiltrated the Keepers'
stronghold all on his own,

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,680
sacrificing himself to
end the Keepers' reign.

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,120
He will always be remembered.

82
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,320
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

83
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,840
Come on, Raindancer.

84
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,720
Riversong was your father.

85
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,000
You should be proud of your family history.

86
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,880
Well, so what?

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,320
I've never met him.

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
Besides,

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,880
he's not the only one who
died in the Rebellion, you know.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The Keepers burned down
an entire Camp Freedom.

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
Aren't those people heroes too?

92
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,640
Maybe you should mention
that it was Stormrunner,

93
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
the great Rebel leader's fault,

94
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
and that he was...

95
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Thank you, Raindancer.

96
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,880
I think that's enough.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,360
We don't want to confuse our
newcomers on their first day, do we?

98
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,760
Okay.

99
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
In short,

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
the Keepers are gone,

101
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,600
a lot of people died,

102
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,000
and the fatherless children who
remained are now very proud.

103
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Applause!

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,720
Close the curtain.

105
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,400
There he goes again.

106
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,895
What?

107
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,120
I'm so sick of talking
about dead people all day.

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,160
I want to learn about physics and math and
biology and the things that really matter.

109
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,520
Oh, you're such a nerd.

110
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,960
What?

111
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,200
No! No, no, no!

112
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,720
If you're not here to learn,

113
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,400
why don't you go the fuck home?

114
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Silence! Silence! This is a university,

115
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,179
not a kindergarten! I said silence!

116
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,400
Oh, excuse me.

117
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,600
Is this the class of Professor Bottlebrush?

118
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:35,480
Huh?

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Hello?

120
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:38,907
Did I miss something?

121
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
What the hell is that?

122
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,440
Is that what I think it is?

123
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,366
Oh,

124
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:51,000
you must be Winstar's foster child.

125
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:52,880
Yep, that's me.

126
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:54,945
I'm sorry for bursting in.

127
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,720
I really wanted to be on time,

128
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,200
but I'm new here,

129
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,279
and well, you know how it goes.

130
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:01,640
And I...

131
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,200
Hey, why are you all staring at me?

132
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,720
Have you never seen a pig before?

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,080
You'll have to excuse them, dear.

134
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Pigs are not very common around here.

135
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,920
Actually, she's not a pig.

136
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,630
She's a Red River Hawk, right?

137
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,993
Very good,

138
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,840
Raindancer.

139
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:22,296
Yes, she is a Red River Hawk,

140
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
and her name is Potami.

141
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Class, say hello to Potami.

142
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,480
Hello,

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,960
Potami.

144
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Hello, everyone.

145
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,040
Welcome to our class,

146
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:32,735
Potami.

147
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,320
Feel free to pick a seat.

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Thank you.

149
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:45,840
I hope you don't mind if I hog the space.

150
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,920
No, of course not.

151
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Why should I?

152
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:01,200
Oh, well, class, it seems
like it's time for a break.

153
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:03,680
The class will resume at half past twelve.

154
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,680
See you then, and please, try not to
kill each other in the meantime, all right?

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
Fine.

156
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,720
Welcome to the Dead Hero Society.

157
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,120
What was your name again?

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,680
Potami, was it?

159
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Yeah,

160
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,080
and hi.

161
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,560
What was your name?

162
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,248
I'm Raindancer.

163
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,480
It's nice to meet you, Raindancer.

164
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,320
So, you really don't
mind sitting next to a pig?

165
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
No, no, why?

166
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,920
Well, is it just me,

167
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,360
or are the people in this
village a little bit narrow-minded?

168
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,040
Yeah, this place is pretty
backwards sometimes.

169
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:46,520
I've been living here all my life,

170
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,960
and people still think I am a weirdo.

171
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,960
Well,

172
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,480
people still think that I am a pig.

173
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,960
So,

174
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,640
if you're not a weirdo,

175
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,440
what are you?

176
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,440
Oh, a bit of this,

177
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,040
a bit of that.

178
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:01,480
A bit of fox,

179
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,360
and a bit of...

180
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
cat?

181
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:05,400
Yeah,

182
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,040
must have been some wild party.

183
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:13,240
So, and you've lived here all your life?

184
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,585
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

185
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,240
I really want to go to
Ironforge when I'm ready for it,

186
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,880
but Uncle Brushy says I
have to finish school first.

187
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,360
Professor Bottlebrush is your uncle?

188
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:27,040
Yeah,

189
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:30,640
well, not really, but
that's kind of a long story.

190
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,600
Another one of those wild parties?

191
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,640
No, no, no, not like that.

192
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:36,672
Not like that.

193
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,880
Freeze!

194
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,920
Don't you dare make a sound,

195
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,484
or I'll put an arrow right between
your eyes before you can even scream.

196
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:53,560
My, what quick learners you are,

197
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
and so obedient too.

198
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,207
You all get an A plus from me.

199
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:04,880
Now, students, I'm afraid there has been
a bit of a change in today's lesson plan.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,960
It's time for all of you to go
on a nice long field trip with us.

201
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,153
I promise the experience will be

202
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:13,608
educational.

203
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:16,160
This way,

204
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,640
we go out the back window.

205
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:21,000
Come on, move it,

206
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,320
and not a sound.

207
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
Who are you?

208
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,120
Where are you taking us?

209
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

210
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:31,022
Now shut up and move!

211
00:09:53,438 --> 00:09:55,040
Welcome back, students.

212
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,680
Break is over and it's time

213
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:57,865
to...

214
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:02,560
Where is everyone?

215
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,240
This better not be
another of your silly pranks.

216
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,640
Hey, this isn't funny.

217
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Come out!

218
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:10,952
What's this?

219
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,547
A note?

220
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,125
Oh, shit!

Nettlebush!

253
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:38,560
Wake up and stay awake, stupid!

254
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:41,077
Someone needs to watch over the hostages!

255
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:44,317
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,135
Don't worry,

257
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,040
I've got everything under control.

258
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,800
The brats are all tied up,

259
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,120
no one's going anywhere!

260
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:54,757
I should hope so! If we lose them,

261
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:56,676
they're gonna cut off your ears!

262
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:59,973
All in the name of the opposition!

263
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,400
What do you think they're
gonna do with them anyway?

264
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,680
Don't know,

265
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,360
don't care.

266
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm not in it for the politics,

267
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
just the money.

268
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,840
The Institute, the Opposition,

269
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,200
or them fucking Keepers of the Light.

270
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,920
Whoever wants to pay us,

271
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,502
no questions asked.

272
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,360
You think, you think
they're gonna kill 'em?

273
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,268
Nah,

274
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
then we wouldn't be hauling them
through them fucking forests here.

275
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:31,280
Right,

276
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:32,535
right.

277
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Um,

278
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
say,

279
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Ivy?

280
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,200
Oh, what?

281
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,080
Would you mind pulling over?

282
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:43,748
Why?

283
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:45,327
I, uh,

284
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:48,560
I gotta pee.

285
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,560
What?

286
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,928
Are you fucking serious?

287
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,280
Oh, for the love of-No!

288
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:57,215
They said we mustn't stop
no matter what happens,

289
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,916
so you better hold it in!

290
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,612
But I really have to go!

291
00:16:00,637 --> 00:16:01,240
Look,

292
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,080
we don't know if there's
anyone following us,

293
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:07,240
and I don't want to be
the one who finds out.

294
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,007
You should have gone before the raid!

295
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,495
I did go before! Come on,

296
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,495
we've been racing full speed for hours
and I always have to go when I'm nervous!

297
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,372
Just get your shit together!

298
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:18,405
I'm trying!

299
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,452
Try harder!

300
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:29,616
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:34,205
I've gotta do what a man's gotta do!

302
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,720
Seriously?

303
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,280
You're seriously going to pee off
the side of a moving fucking wagon?

304
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,597
What do you want me to do?

305
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
Wipe my pants?

306
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
No, let me do my business!

307
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,560
I don't fucking believe this!

308
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:08,080
That thing tastes like
my mother's old socks!

309
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,440
Hey, Raindancer,

310
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,609
turn around so I can chew
through your ropes, quick!

311
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,376
Are you done yet?

312
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,520
Sit down, man!

313
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:24,095
Hey! I can't pee if you're watching me!

314
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,920
This is my fault now! You were the one
that decided to stand right there to piss!

315
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,506
Well, you were the one
that wouldn't stop the wagon!

316
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:35,250
Ugh...

317
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:39,314
There! You're free!

318
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:47,908
Wow,

319
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:48,724
thanks.

320
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:50,777
Wow, you've got some sharp teeth!

321
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,200
Yeah, I hate being hogtied.

322
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:55,470
So,

323
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:59,040
should I ask you why you know
how your mom's socks taste?

324
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:00,128
No,

325
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,000
you should untie my paws!

326
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:02,655
Oh, right, yeah.

327
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,631
Quick, before that moron comes back!

328
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:17,120
By the holy mountain, that's disgusting!

329
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:20,636
Try not to hit the canopy, you idiot!

330
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:25,786
Watch the bloody roads!

331
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:28,040
Oops, was that a pothole?

332
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
Oh, my bad!

333
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:31,296
Oh, look,

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,080
there is another one!

335
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:36,640
And...

336
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,600
another one!

337
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,040
Who knew there were so
many in this road all of a sudden?

338
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,840
I'm gonna kill you! I swear! As
soon as we're back in Ironforge,

339
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm gonna kill you!

340
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:56,688
Gh...

341
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
Yes, thank you.

342
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:00,006
Raindancer,

343
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:02,640
quick, where did they put my bag?

344
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:04,659
We need to free the others!

345
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah, but I need my bag! This is important!

346
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,880
Okay...

347
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:10,785
Oh, gosh, there it is!

348
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:12,907
Got it!

349
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,135
Alright!

350
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,160
I feel so much better!

351
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:22,465
No thanks to you and your driving!

352
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:26,827
Congrats, fuckinglations!
Achievement unlocked! Now

353
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:31,680
get your bloody arse back
there and do your fucking job!

354
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,480
Yeah, yeah...

355
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,814
Oh, quick, quick, quick! He's returning!

356
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,600
Oh, shit! We are out of time!

357
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,215
What?

358
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,440
We need to free the others!

359
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,560
-We have to jump!
-No, no!

360
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,800
Yes!

361
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,960
I said jump! No time!

362
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,050
Go!

363
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:53,360
-Oi! Oi, stop it!
-Oink, oink, motherfucker!

364
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,160
Oi!

365
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:58,116
Stop the wagon! Stop the fucking wagon!

366
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:00,680
What the fuck is going on back there?

367
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,240
Two of the damn brats just
jumped ship! We gotta go after them!

368
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,680
No fucking way! It's the
Darkwoods, remember?

369
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,040
They don't have a Light!

370
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,280
Those two aren't going to get far before
the beasts will make a quick snack of them!

371
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,800
The nights out here are
dark and full of terrors!

372
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:20,455
It wasn't my fault! I swear!

373
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,880
Of course it's your fault!
If you had been watching,

374
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
then they wouldn't have gotten free!

375
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,440
No fucking way I'm gonna
waste more precious time!

376
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,844
Just cause you're just
literally too stupid to piss!

377
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,008
But, but, but, but, but...

378
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:41,815
No buts! We're already running late!
And we still have plenty of brats left!

379
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,440
Now go and check on the rest!
We don't want to lose another one!

380
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,565
And if they do cut our pay,

381
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,520
it's coming out of your share!

382
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:53,792
Okay, okay...

383
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:56,184
Fucktards!

384
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:57,561
Damn idiots!

385
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,935
The privilege of opening the first
trial for the crimes committed

386
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,840
by the Keepers of the Light
imposes a grave responsibility.

387
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:23,257
The wrongs which we seek to
punish have been so calculated

388
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,337
and so malignant that civilization
cannot tolerate their being ignored,

389
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:31,960
because it cannot survive
their being repeated.

390
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,104
The defendants in this case
represent sinister influences

391
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:41,164
that will lurk in the world long after their
bodies have returned to dust.

392
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,603
We will show them to be
living symbols of hatred,

393
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:45,556
terrorism,

394
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:46,760
and violence,

395
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,013
and of the arrogance and cruelty of Power.

396
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,295
It would have been
easy to treat them in the

397
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,955
same way like they treated
their own adversaries,

398
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:57,567
but these trials shall
be the most significant

399
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:01,360
tribute that Power has
ever paid to reason.

400
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,520
The accused will be given a fair
opportunity to defend themselves,

401
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,210
a favor which the Order of the
Keepers rarely extended to their enemies.

402
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,035
Despite the fact that public
opinion already condemns their acts,

403
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:18,256
they must be given a
presumption of innocence.

404
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:22,444
I now call the defendant
to the witness stand.

405
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:24,632
Will you give your full name?

406
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,857
My name is Falconeye of Quails Hollow.

407
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:32,777
What was your rank within the
Order of the Keepers of the Light?

408
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,737
Security Administrator.

409
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:38,240
According to our new procedures,

410
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,220
you have the right to
appoint a Defense Counsel.

411
00:22:41,347 --> 00:22:43,857
I would rather prefer to defend myself,

412
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,491
if you don't mind.

413
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:46,646
Very well.

414
00:22:46,718 --> 00:22:47,680
Prosecutor,

415
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,761
you may begin your examination.

416
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:53,240
Falconeye,

417
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,684
you are being accused of murder
of Brother Fireheart of Coat Lake,

418
00:22:57,795 --> 00:23:01,051
the complicity to murder in
at least 300 cases by your

419
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:05,311
involvement with the so-called
Cloak and Dagger Decree,

420
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,381
and at least another 250 cases

421
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:12,080
by the obliteration of the Rebel
Headquarters at Camp Freedom.

422
00:23:12,164 --> 00:23:13,932
What do you have
to say regarding these

423
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,320
accusations which have
been brought against you?

424
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,518
I can only say that I
asked the Tribunal to decide

425
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:23,000
upon the degree of my
guilt at the end of my case.

426
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:24,600
I, myself,

427
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,200
speaking from the very
depths of my feelings,

428
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,532
want to say that now,

429
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:32,220
after I have gained
a full insight into all

430
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:35,080
the horrible deeds which
have been committed,

431
00:23:35,153 --> 00:23:38,600
I am possessed by a deep sense of guilt.

432
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:43,314
Are you trying to say that you knew nothing
about the atrocities at Camp Freedom?

433
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,320
That is hard to believe.

434
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:50,400
This operation was executed
directly by Great Overseer Ironwill.

435
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,360
I had nothing to do with it.

436
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,805
As my fellow brothers can testify,

437
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,445
I was at the Holy Mountain the whole time.

438
00:23:57,493 --> 00:23:59,827
But you also did nothing to stop him.

439
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:03,213
I did not even know
about his plans until he

440
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,955
and Brother Strongarm
returned with the prisoner.

441
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,160
You were poorly informed for the
Chief Overseer Security Administrator.

442
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:13,237
You cannot prove what I knew or not.

443
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:17,280
There is no question you knew
about the Cloak and Dagger Decree.

444
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:22,840
I have here the original
document, Exhibit FE-001.

445
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Let me quote.

446
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:28,648
The punishment for offenses committed
against the Keepers of the Light is,

447
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,140
on principle, the death penalty.

448
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:33,963
Offenses are to be
dealt within the field only

449
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:36,504
if it is probable that
the sentence of death

450
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:38,604
will be passed upon
the offender

451
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:42,503
and the execution can be completed
in a very short time.

452
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:46,160
Otherwise, the offenders are to
be taken to the Holy Mountain.

453
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,280
In case anybody inquires
about such prisoners,

454
00:24:49,317 --> 00:24:51,960
they are to be told that
they have been arrested

455
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,460
but the proceedings do not
allow any further information.

456
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,983
End quote.

457
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,720
Did you write this decree?

458
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:00,720
Yes.

459
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,328
So you assume full responsibility?

460
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:04,200
No.

461
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,627
But you wrote it.

462
00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:09,232
Well, there is a principle
which says that nobody can

463
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:13,200
transfer more rights to anybody
else than he has himself.

464
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,200
I was just a subordinate
to great overseer Ironwill.

465
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,201
He wanted to keep the population quiet by
demoting an atmosphere of mystery and fear.

466
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:26,649
So I did as I was told. But only
he could make a decision.

467
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:32,342
I neither had the power nor the authority
to put this decree into effect.

468
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:37,497
Acting pursuant to order of a superior
does not relieve you from responsibility.

469
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:41,080
You could have made a
moral choice, but you didn't.

470
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,612
Because of your decree,

471
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:45,403
hundreds of citizens disappeared overnight,

472
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,577
and their families never
knew what happened to them.

473
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:50,080
Please leave the judging to me,

474
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:50,920
prosecutor.

475
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,695
I'm sorry, your honor.

476
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,680
I was getting carried away.

477
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,000
Falconeye,

478
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,440
what about the murder of brother Fireheart?

479
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,800
Are you going to deny
responsibility for that too?

480
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:04,906
I did what I was ordered to do.

481
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,598
These were thankless and difficult tasks.

482
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:13,440
I had to fulfill the overseer's commands
under the hardiest exigencies of duty,

483
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:19,200
often acting against the inner voice of my
conscience and against my own convictions.

484
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,457
The fulfillment of
urgent tasks assigned by overseer Ironwill

485
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,755
 demanded
complete self-abnegation.

486
00:26:27,818 --> 00:26:29,840
I don't know what to say.

487
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:30,950
Your honor,

488
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,440
I need a break.

489
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,920
This is my first trial under the new rules,

490
00:26:34,981 --> 00:26:38,800
and staying professional turns
out to be a lot harder than I thought.

491
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,589
This is just the first trial of many.

492
00:26:41,827 --> 00:26:43,360
What the Keepers stand for,

493
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:46,640
we will patiently and temperately disclose.

494
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,240
And we do not depend on their
testimony or that of their foes.

495
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:55,199
We have undeniable
proof of incredible events.

496
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:59,800
The tribunal will now adjourn
until ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

497
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,369
Come in.

498
00:27:12,595 --> 00:27:14,320
Lady Goldeneyes,

499
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:16,720
Sir Whisperwind wishes to speak with you.

500
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:17,880
Finally.

501
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,280
Send him in.

502
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,654
Yes, my lady.

503
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:34,040
Whisperwind, I've been
waiting for you all day.

504
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:35,410
What took you so long?

505
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:38,560
I'm doing fine, thanks for asking.

506
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,640
How about you, my lady?

507
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:43,233
So, tell me, how did the mission go?

508
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,480
Without a hitch.

509
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:48,280
Ivydash and Nettlebush made it
back from Ferndale in one piece,

510
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:51,200
and they brought a good
dozen hostages with them.

511
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,289
What a great day for the Opposition.

512
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:55,920
How have they been holding up?

513
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,892
Was there a lot of resistance?

514
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:59,613
They had an easy time.

515
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,680
The teacher wasn't in the classroom.

516
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,808
All they had to do was
round everyone up and go.

517
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:06,840
That sounds good.

518
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,191
Two of them managed to escape
from the wagon during the ride,

519
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:12,640
but they are not going to be a problem.

520
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,137
And that sounds not so good.

521
00:28:15,418 --> 00:28:17,240
Who were they?

522
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,120
Don't ask me.

523
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,680
One of them was some kind
weirdo of Mongrel, the other one...

524
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,587
a pig?

525
00:28:24,612 --> 00:28:25,400
Wait,

526
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,400
what?

527
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,720
A pig?

528
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's what they said.

529
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:31,200
Why?

530
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,360
Oh, stupid idiots!

531
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,728
I am sorry?

532
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,863
Why didn't they go after them?

533
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:41,200
The kids are probably already dead,

534
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:42,920
and if not, they will be soon.

535
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:43,600
Calm down.

536
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,000
Everything will be okay.

537
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,320
The scheme is still going to work.

538
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,126
That's not the point!

539
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:51,855
Then what is your point?

540
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:54,215
By the holy mountain,

541
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,758
why do I have to justify everything to you?

542
00:28:56,783 --> 00:29:00,858
Because as your future husband I need
to understand what the hell you're up to.

543
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:05,800
You seem just a bit too
eager for your new position.

544
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,413
This is so much more
than just a new position.

545
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,280
We are at the beginning of a new age.

546
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:14,120
Lord Quicksilver, may he rest in peace,

547
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,920
has been gone for many years,

548
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,680
and there is still no legitimate successor.

549
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:22,080
I am his only heir.

550
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,826
It doesn't get more legitimate than that.

551
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,280
But people don't see you like that.

552
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:32,320
They see you as the
Lord's widow, nothing more.

553
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:34,114
But as soon as we are Lord and Lady,

554
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:38,480
this will change, and the
Opposition will firmly stand behind us.

555
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:43,461
Don't forget, I still have the powers
of the ancestors ready at my fingertips.

556
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:45,560
And that's good,

557
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,986
but it's a single artifact and
it's not going to last forever.

558
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:51,280
We need to learn how to build our own,

559
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:52,920
but that might take a long time,

560
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:55,240
even if the Institute
gives us what we want.

561
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:59,200
And for that you just
stirred up the hornet's nest.

562
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:01,280
Ferndale is a long way from here.

563
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,477
I really don't want anything
bad happening to you.

564
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,040
I love you.

565
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,714
Then stop acting like you're
already the king of the land!

566
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,440
I have my personal reasons,

567
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:16,520
and I am still the Princess of Ironforge.

568
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,280
I can do whatever I please.

569
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:22,680
If you won't go after the escapees,

570
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
I will.

571
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:25,280
But that's crazy.

572
00:30:25,305 --> 00:30:27,091
If the Institute has sent a search party,

573
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,480
there's a good chance
you will run straight into it.

574
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,823
Why do these two kids
matter so much to you?

575
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,320
Greenfield, get my mount ready.

576
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:38,241
I need to go out of town.

577
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:40,320
Meet me in the courtyard in an hour.

578
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:42,815
Yes,

579
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
my lady.

580
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:45,728
Your wish is my command.

581
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:49,160
Goldeneyes, you can't
leave so close to the wedding.

582
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:51,080
What if something happens to you?

583
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
I need you here.

584
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:54,080
Ironforge needs you here.

585
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,424
Then you go!

586
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:56,700
But why?

587
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:03,006
Is there anything I can do for you, sir?

588
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,040
This woman is giving
me a hell of a headache.

589
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,743
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

590
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:12,118
Would the sir like a glass of water?

591
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:14,680
Yes, that would be good.

592
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,843
Or wait, could I have a cup of tea instead?

593
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,391
Certainly.

594
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:21,387
Which kind of tea would the sir prefer?

595
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:23,800
I'll have rosehip tea, please.

596
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:25,400
Rosehip and ginger,

597
00:31:25,714 --> 00:31:26,600
with

598
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
a little bit of orange blossom honey.

599
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:30,720
Yes, could you do that for me?

600
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,890
I'm not sure we have that,

601
00:31:33,136 --> 00:31:35,240
but I shall certainly try.

602
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:36,920
Thank you very much, Greenfield.

603
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:38,400
Just take your time.

604
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,880
I am not in a rush.

605
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,120
As you wish,

606
00:31:41,168 --> 00:31:42,240
sir.

607
00:31:49,303 --> 00:31:51,418
I hope that will keep him
occupied for a while.

608
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,454
Now let's see...

609
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:58,018
She never had second
thoughts about our relationship.

610
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,008
Why is she suddenly getting cold feet?

611
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,489
She know something I don't?

612
00:32:08,797 --> 00:32:11,546
Also, why does she
suddenly bring up the artifact?

613
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:14,936
Wait a minute...

614
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,280
She used to wear it on her belt
pretty much all the time, but not today.

615
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:22,080
It might just be a coincidence,

616
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,993
but what if it isn't?

617
00:32:25,258 --> 00:32:28,958
Now where does she usually keep that thing?

618
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:30,828
Ah, there.

619
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:42,432
Now comes the moment of truth.

620
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:44,520
Oh,

621
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,159
it's not even locked.

622
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:52,800
Wow.

623
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:55,387
Now this explains a lot.

624
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,600
Okay, Bottlebrush, that's it.

625
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,360
I am not going to wait any longer.

626
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,640
If you don't act now,

627
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,440
I will.

628
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:19,240
Oh, Thistlethorn, what
happened to knocking first?

629
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,960
I thought Raindancer was like a son to you.

630
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:24,960
I don't understand how you
can just sit there and do nothing.

631
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:26,454
These are our children,

632
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,560
for the gods sake.

633
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,611
Yes, they are.

634
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,575
And just because I'm
not running around like a

635
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,019
headless chicken doesn't
mean I am doing nothing.

636
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:34,360
You keep saying that,

637
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,920
but where are the results?

638
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,640
We are running out of time.

639
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,480
Why don't we negotiate with them?

640
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:43,360
Because you don't negotiate with
blackmailers unless you absolutely have to.

641
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,800
But we only have two more days.

642
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,560
Two days can be a
lot of time, Thistlethorn.

643
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,920
I trust my men to know what they are doing.

644
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,000
They have already tracked the
kidnappers halfway through the Dark Woods,

645
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,976
and we have narrowed
their possible destinations

646
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,840
down to less than
a handful of cities.

647
00:33:57,865 --> 00:34:00,040
Ha! Less than a handful.

648
00:34:00,132 --> 00:34:01,520
What an achievement.

649
00:34:01,552 --> 00:34:04,160
Look, Bottlebrush, I am not stupid.

650
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,560
It's been raining all night.

651
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,080
If there were any tracks,

652
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:08,520
they're gone now.

653
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:10,520
Your experts are stuck.

654
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:12,200
Why can't you just admit it?

655
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,360
They are using proven scientific methods.

656
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:16,800
Methods that nobody has ever tried before.

657
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:19,080
Our ancestors aren't quite nobody,

658
00:34:19,114 --> 00:34:19,861
are they?

659
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,160
You have a smug answer
to everything, haven't you?

660
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:24,600
Professor Bottlebrush,

661
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,640
the smartass in charge.

662
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:29,119
And yet it is you and
your damn institute who

663
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:32,080
got us into all this
trouble in the first place.

664
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:35,574
Hundreds of rebels have
died to free our ancestors'

665
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,000
thoughts and ideas from
the Keepers of the Light,

666
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:41,595
and you have done nothing
better than locking them back up.

667
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,867
The knowledge of an entire
civilization put behind iron doors.

668
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:48,240
No wonder the opposition thinks we're scum.

669
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,720
The Keepers of the Light are gone,

670
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,400
but nothing has changed.

671
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:53,672
I have a question for you, Thistlethorn.

672
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:58,480
Do you know what the most defining
characteristic of human civilization is?

673
00:34:58,505 --> 00:34:58,985
Oh,

674
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:00,200
enlighten me.

675
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,200
It no longer exists.

676
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:06,400
The very science that led to
its rise also led to its downfall.

677
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,840
Do you want history to repeat itself?

678
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,891
If yes,

679
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:13,880
go ahead and drop all that human
knowledge on our society like a bomb.

680
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,320
If no, we have to share
the knowledge responsibly.

681
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,000
That is what our schools are for.

682
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:21,080
We do not only teach science,

683
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,520
we also teach history and ethics.

684
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,680
Those things must go hand in hand.

685
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:28,640
I promise you that knowledge
will not remain locked up.

686
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:30,800
We will share it, all of it,

687
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,611
but we'll do it responsibly.

688
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:36,880
We own the biggest arsenal
of weapons in the world.

689
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,058
And yet we let those criminals
walk into our classroom

690
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,527
with nothing but swords and
crossbows and take our kids.

691
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,000
Is that what you call acting responsibly?

692
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,866
Would you have preferred
them walking into the

693
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:50,280
classroom with grenades
and assault rifles instead?

694
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,000
That is not what I said.

695
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,960
No?

696
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,197
Then what do you think
would happen if we opened

697
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,811
the walls underneath the
Holy Mountain to everyone?

698
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,640
Thistle, it doesn't work that way.

699
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,880
We will get our sons and daughters back.

700
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:05,680
And we are going to use
weapons if we have to.

701
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,920
But it will be the last
thing to try, not the first.

702
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:10,960
I wouldn't want to live
in a world where it is.

703
00:36:11,027 --> 00:36:12,080
Would you?

704
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:13,560
No.

705
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:16,096
No, I wouldn't.

706
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:40,531
Rainie, no!

707
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:52,226
Holy mother of all that is fluffy.

708
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:54,095
We did it.

709
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:58,439
That must have been the scariest
thing I've ever done in my life.

710
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:02,040
You get used to it after a while.

711
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,040
I have done this so many times.

712
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,440
I knew it would work.

713
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,093
It always works.

714
00:37:11,885 --> 00:37:12,655
Well,

715
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,188
most of the time anyway.

716
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:19,960
This better be worth it.

717
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Oh, trust me.

718
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,280
I've been on my own for such a long time.

719
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,756
I know how to get rid of the pigrats.

720
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:28,083
Just do what I do.

721
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:29,161
Okay.

722
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:37,132
Really?

723
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,243
Do I have to?

724
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,208
Oh, come on.

725
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:41,280
Just do it.

726
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:43,104
Okay.

727
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:49,618
Good.

728
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,080
And now we put them
on display for the others.

729
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,157
Mine goes over here.

730
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:03,936
And yours goes over there.

731
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,793
Wow.

732
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,384
This is seriously creepy.

733
00:38:15,471 --> 00:38:16,400
Mm-hmm.

734
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,720
And the great thing is,

735
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,760
it's creepy for other pigrats too.

736
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,965
It will make them stay far away.

737
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:24,800
That makes a lot of sense.

738
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,128
It must be part of their herd instinct.

739
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:29,291
Avoiding places where
others have died gives

740
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:31,778
them an evolutionary
advantage, you know?

741
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,135
Yeah,

742
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,200
exactly that.

743
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:36,043
Whatever that means.

744
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:39,840
I think we can light the fire now.

745
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,451
Oh, yeah.

746
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:41,310
I can do that.

747
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,450
Just give me a second.

748
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:46,885
Oh.

749
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:52,187
Wow.

750
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:54,530
Wow.

751
00:38:55,316 --> 00:38:57,880
How did you do that so fast?

752
00:38:58,764 --> 00:39:00,840
This is called a lighter.

753
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,760
It's a human artifact.

754
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:04,560
I took it...

755
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,400
I mean, I borrowed it from Uncle Brushy.

756
00:39:07,824 --> 00:39:09,440
We live in the same house, kind of.

757
00:39:09,522 --> 00:39:12,308
Oh, the good old five-finger discount.

758
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:13,375
No, no, no.

759
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,990
I was going to give it back.

760
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,055
Hmm.

761
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,360
Oh, come on.

762
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:20,720
Since the keepers are gone,

763
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,080
everyone and their kids is out
for the hunt of human artifacts.

764
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:25,600
I would do the same.

765
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,958
Uncle Brushy can't stop ranting
about how everybody is now

766
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:31,530
hoping to find something
ancient they can sell for money.

767
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:35,240
The moment the keepers were gone,

768
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:38,895
some sites were literally
ripped apart by treasure hunters.

769
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:41,136
Seems like this was
one of the few things the

770
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:44,240
keepers did right when
they were still around.

771
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:47,250
A lot of people say
there is not much of a

772
00:39:47,275 --> 00:39:49,801
difference between the
Institute and the keepers.

773
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,920
Who would say such a thing?

774
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,844
The opposition,

775
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:53,655
for example.

776
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,560
They're wrong.

777
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,040
The Institute is a scientific organization.

778
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:01,954
Then why do they guard
their knowledge like it's sacred?

779
00:40:02,082 --> 00:40:06,400
Because they're afraid
that history will repeat itself.

780
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,314
Our culture is not ready yet.

781
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:12,819
The Institute works hard to
make sure that one day we will be,

782
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,000
but until then, some things
are better kept under wraps.

783
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,200
But that's almost exactly
what the keepers said.

784
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,160
No, no, no.

785
00:40:20,662 --> 00:40:21,874
You just don't get it.

786
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:23,240
Whatever.

787
00:40:23,328 --> 00:40:24,768
I'm just a pig.

788
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,800
What am I supposed to know about politics?

789
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:30,360
Well, you did join us
for a reason, didn't you?

790
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:33,640
That was because of personal reasons.

791
00:40:33,704 --> 00:40:34,704
Nothing political.

792
00:40:36,203 --> 00:40:37,111
Your family?

793
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:40,727
I don't want to talk about it.

794
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,071
Why?

795
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,000
What happened to them?

796
00:40:44,072 --> 00:40:44,712
Well,

797
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:46,659
what happened to yours?

798
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:49,920
Well, my father died saving the world.

799
00:40:50,754 --> 00:40:53,954
And now everybody
expects me to do the same.

800
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:57,139
You're not quite dead yet.

801
00:40:57,179 --> 00:40:59,929
No, and I'm not planning
to save the world either.

802
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,106
I just want to learn.

803
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:08,000
Isn't that the university symbol
you are wearing around your neck?

804
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,320
The Tree of Knowledge?

805
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,920
Yeah, my mother gave
it to me when I was little.

806
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,405
It has a long history,

807
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,292
like everything else at our home.

808
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:19,094
There's so much to discover in
the old books that I could spend

809
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,715
a lifetime in Uncle Brushy's
room and never finish it all.

810
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:25,360
Like all the super secret stuff?

811
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,560
Most of it isn't,

812
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:27,976
but nobody really cares.

813
00:41:28,143 --> 00:41:29,583
Like what?

814
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,632
Look at the sky.

815
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:36,107
Would you believe they
could put machines up there?

816
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:38,549
They put machines up
there which stayed there

817
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,080
on their own for hundreds of years.

818
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:43,804
Most of them have stopped
working a long time ago.

819
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,535
Whenever you see a shooting star,

820
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,633
it might actually be
one of the old satellites

821
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:49,800
burning as it falls back to the earth.

822
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:50,825
Wow,

823
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,200
that is amazing.

824
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,320
I could go on like that for hours.

825
00:41:55,385 --> 00:41:56,794
I can imagine.

826
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,200
But no matter where we will go,

827
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,129
it's going to be a long walk.

828
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,600
We really should get all the sleep we can.

829
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:06,907
I don't think I'll be able to.

830
00:42:07,613 --> 00:42:09,339
I never slept outside before.

831
00:42:09,425 --> 00:42:11,520
It's scary and cold.

832
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,126
Then why don't you come over here?

833
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:16,563
And then?

834
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:17,464
Well,

835
00:42:17,942 --> 00:42:20,800
we could cuddle up and
keep each other warm.

836
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,600
What?

837
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,320
But we barely know each other.

838
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,302
Oh, well, we will know each
other much better afterwards.

839
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:33,684
And it will make the night
a lot less cold and lonely.

840
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:34,495
Seriously?

841
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,455
You like to cuddle with random guys?

842
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
No,

843
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,240
only with those I like.

844
00:42:39,288 --> 00:42:40,339
Oh, OK.

845
00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:41,275
Yeah.

846
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,135
Thanks.

847
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:44,250
What's the problem?

848
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:46,162
It's going way too fast.

849
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:47,760
I don't even I mean,

850
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,280
I've not been with.

851
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Oh,

852
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,187
you've never been alone with a girl before.

853
00:42:54,212 --> 00:42:56,120
Wait, wait, time out, time out.

854
00:42:56,901 --> 00:43:00,000
Like not at all at your age?

855
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,400
I mean, how did that
happen or rather not happen?

856
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,400
Because I'm a bloody nerd.

857
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:08,480
And what's the problem with that?

858
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,553
I don't know.

859
00:43:09,648 --> 00:43:10,600
I mean,

860
00:43:12,553 --> 00:43:13,971
you know what?

861
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:16,800
You don't know how, huh?

862
00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:17,528
How...

863
00:43:18,322 --> 00:43:21,840
-How to...
-How to have sex with a girl?

864
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:22,392
Oh,

865
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,396
Oh well, don't worry.

866
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:26,880
I can teach you that.

867
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:32,637
Oh come on.

868
00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:35,360
I was just messing with you.

869
00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:37,120
Believe it or not,

870
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:38,840
I'm cold and lonely, too.

871
00:43:38,905 --> 00:43:42,040
How come you never seem
to be afraid of anything?

872
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,880
Because being a pig
means having a tough life.

873
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:48,640
I just stopped being afraid at some point.

874
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,920
And you know what?

875
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:52,206
Life has been a lot easier since then.

876
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:56,889
I have to show you something.

877
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:58,720
OK, what is it?

878
00:43:58,768 --> 00:43:59,768
Just a second.

879
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,338
Have you ever seen something like

880
00:44:04,928 --> 00:44:05,648
this?

881
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:06,360
Holy fuck!

882
00:44:06,385 --> 00:44:07,520
Point that away from me.

883
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,544
Oh, it seems you have.

884
00:44:09,712 --> 00:44:10,991
Oh, well, don't worry.

885
00:44:11,136 --> 00:44:12,080
It's broken.

886
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:13,595
It doesn't do anything.

887
00:44:13,977 --> 00:44:15,567
Where on earth did you get this?

888
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:16,272
That

889
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
is a gun,

890
00:44:17,536 --> 00:44:19,256
a pistol, a human weapon.

891
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,960
You're not supposed to have that.

892
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,280
- If the Institute find out you have that, then...
- Shh, calm down.

893
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,834
Nobody knows.

894
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,890
I found this on my way
through the Sea of debris.

895
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,775
I was digging for truffles and...

896
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,545
Truffles?

897
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:33,275
Eh, it's a pig thing.

898
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:34,402
OK.

899
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:41,023
Anyway, this was in a sealed box
wrapped in some kind of oily rags.

900
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,120
How did you even know what it was?

901
00:44:43,191 --> 00:44:44,054
I, um...

902
00:44:44,427 --> 00:44:45,960
I heard about it before.

903
00:44:46,322 --> 00:44:49,160
It's supposed to contain
some kind of evil magic.

904
00:44:49,326 --> 00:44:51,320
But I think it's long gone.

905
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:53,038
It doesn't do anything.

906
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:54,136
Oh.

907
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,860
Can I have a look?

908
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,829
Give it to me, please.

909
00:44:58,877 --> 00:45:00,360
Carefully.

910
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,720
OK.

911
00:45:06,915 --> 00:45:08,002
It's not loaded.

912
00:45:09,296 --> 00:45:10,882
But it's in very good condition.

913
00:45:10,954 --> 00:45:12,192
Exceptionally good.

914
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:16,528
I know a few people who would
pay a fortune for an artefact like this.

915
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,440
I wasn't going to sell it.

916
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:19,896
Yeah, and you shouldn't.

917
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:21,965
If this gets in the wrong hands,

918
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:23,575
all hell is going to break loose.

919
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,727
Oh! It is that dangerous?

920
00:45:25,752 --> 00:45:27,920
Oh yes. It's a deadly weapon.

921
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,640
And it cannot only hurt
others, but also you.

922
00:45:30,921 --> 00:45:32,898
You have to keep it oiled and clean.

923
00:45:32,923 --> 00:45:35,408
And if there's any rust
or dirt blocking the barrel,

924
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,790
it can explode right into your paw.

925
00:45:38,357 --> 00:45:39,621
The bullets go in here,

926
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:41,040
into the clip down here.

927
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:43,808
And then you need to
flip the safety off here.

928
00:45:44,118 --> 00:45:45,470
Then you work the slide.

929
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,240
And that will move the bullet
into the chamber, like this.

930
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:51,269
And then you point it at your target...

931
00:45:52,735 --> 00:45:53,954
and pull the trigger.

932
00:45:57,953 --> 00:46:00,120
Uncle Brushy let me
fire a gun like this once.

933
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,120
Wow.

934
00:46:01,184 --> 00:46:02,184
What is it like?

935
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,762
Not very nice.

936
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,941
It makes a really loud bang.

937
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,417
And the recoil makes your paws hurt.

938
00:46:08,576 --> 00:46:09,040
I...

939
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:12,332
well, you could instantly
kill anybody it's pointed at.

940
00:46:13,779 --> 00:46:14,960
It scared the hell out of me.

941
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:15,825
Wow.

942
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:19,080
Well, good thing I didn't
leave the bag on the carriage.

943
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,024
Unfortunately, a gun is
useless without ammunition, so...

944
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:26,880
I feel so bad about the other students.

945
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,760
We could have saved them.

946
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,473
Hmm.

947
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,680
Maybe we can still do that.

948
00:46:31,768 --> 00:46:34,419
Ah, if we only knew where
to find some communition.

949
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:36,400
It's ammunition,

950
00:46:36,425 --> 00:46:37,560
not communition.

951
00:46:38,687 --> 00:46:39,687
Bullets.

952
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:41,979
But even if we had any,

953
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:43,599
and we knew how to find the others,

954
00:46:43,624 --> 00:46:44,720
what would you do?

955
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:47,219
Walk in and kill everybody in your path?

956
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:51,345
Ah, don't you have at least a little
bit of your father's hero blood?

957
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,720
Trivia question.

958
00:46:54,664 --> 00:46:57,795
What is the biggest difference
between me and my father?

959
00:46:59,239 --> 00:46:59,960
Beats me.

960
00:47:00,015 --> 00:47:01,760
My father is dead!

961
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,880
Oh, touche.

962
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,828
That sounded almost literate.

963
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:08,357
Oh, you!

964
00:47:09,398 --> 00:47:10,970
Don't take me! No, no, no!

965
00:47:14,887 --> 00:47:15,758
See?

966
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,480
I touched you and you didn't die.

967
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:20,980
Can't you ever take anything serious?

968
00:47:21,107 --> 00:47:23,400
Ah, screw serious!

969
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,760
Survival happens in your head.

970
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:28,828
Are you sure you want to
sleep all alone in the cold?

971
00:47:29,552 --> 00:47:32,032
I promise you don't
have to be afraid of me,

972
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,360
or anything else, as long as I am around.

973
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:37,760
Hmm?

974
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:39,240
Oh, come here.

975
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,223
I will take care of you.

976
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:43,917
And I'm a lot fluffier than I look.

977
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,390
Oh, what the hell, why not.

978
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:56,920
Thanks.

979
00:47:57,024 --> 00:47:58,186
You're really nice.

980
00:47:58,285 --> 00:48:00,445
Shh! Don't tell anyone.

981
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:04,562
Oh, Quicksilver,

982
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:09,275
this city is going to the
dogs and no matter what I try,

983
00:49:10,136 --> 00:49:12,000
it just keeps getting worse.

984
00:49:15,647 --> 00:49:19,546
You wouldn't believe how much
things have gone downhill since you left.

985
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:22,880
Tomorrow is the wedding.

986
00:49:23,324 --> 00:49:25,720
I've been told it's the right thing to do.

987
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:28,280
The right thing for Ironforge.

988
00:49:28,344 --> 00:49:29,344
And yet,

989
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,814
it feels so wrong.

990
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:40,040
I know you believed in rebellion
and that's why you had to join them.

991
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:41,880
But now that you're dead,

992
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,320
I don't know what's
right or wrong anymore.

993
00:49:44,884 --> 00:49:47,074
I miss you so much right now.

994
00:49:54,145 --> 00:49:55,290
For the last time,

995
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:57,040
no money, no booze.

996
00:49:57,065 --> 00:49:58,625
Now get the fuck out.

997
00:50:06,093 --> 00:50:07,480
You're a joke.

998
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:09,088
A fucking joke.

999
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:12,160
We know where your house lives.

1000
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,135
And you're a fucking whore of a wife.

1001
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,203
Yeah, I bet she didn't
have a good fuck in years.

1002
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,960
By some real men,

1003
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,677
not some lame dick like you!

1004
00:50:22,702 --> 00:50:25,776
Yeah, let's go and fuck her good.

1005
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:32,572
Come on, I still have a few bottles
of Golden Marywood at home.

1006
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:33,640
Fuck yeah.

1007
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:34,240
Hey,

1008
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:35,800
what the hell?

1009
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,266
Do you see what I see?

1010
00:50:38,345 --> 00:50:38,941
Where?

1011
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:40,240
Over there.

1012
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,225
Isn't that the good lady Goldeneyes?

1013
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:46,845
Holy shit, she's hot.

1014
00:50:46,908 --> 00:50:52,400
Hey, what's a pretty kitty
like you doing here all alone?

1015
00:50:52,487 --> 00:50:54,440
That's none of your business.

1016
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,000
Well,

1017
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:59,320
if it isn't the grave of Lord Quicksilver,

1018
00:50:59,384 --> 00:51:00,800
the old coward.

1019
00:51:00,877 --> 00:51:03,720
He was not a coward.

1020
00:51:03,806 --> 00:51:05,335
Now get lost!

1021
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,800
Not a coward?

1022
00:51:06,886 --> 00:51:09,900
My ass, he fucking ran away!

1023
00:51:09,925 --> 00:51:11,421
For a bloody rebellion!

1024
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:13,926
For a rebellion that did nothing.

1025
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:16,400
You'd better watch your mouth.

1026
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:18,773
I am the Princess of Ironforge.

1027
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:21,477
Princess of Ironforge?

1028
00:51:21,565 --> 00:51:23,480
You're not a princess.

1029
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:24,880
You're a pussy!

1030
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,605
What you gonna do?

1031
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,080
Scratch us with your pretty claws?

1032
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:30,880
Kill us with your magic stick?

1033
00:51:30,961 --> 00:51:33,501
We ain't got nothing to lose!

1034
00:51:33,526 --> 00:51:36,280
Nothing's worse than
living in this shithole.

1035
00:51:36,387 --> 00:51:37,955
We should rename it to

1036
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,324
Iron-forgery!

1037
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:44,360
Yeah, fuck you and fuck Lord Quicksilver!

1038
00:51:46,764 --> 00:51:47,520
You know what?

1039
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,000
I'm gonna piss on his grave.

1040
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,529
Oh no, you won't.

1041
00:51:51,554 --> 00:51:53,720
Oh yes, he will.

1042
00:51:56,936 --> 00:51:57,936
Stop.

1043
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,840
Pussy has claws, eh?

1044
00:52:06,922 --> 00:52:09,300
Now that turns me on.

1045
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:11,577
And me, too!

1046
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,240
Hey, pussy, pussy, pussy.

1047
00:52:15,447 --> 00:52:16,050
No,

1048
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,163
go away!

1049
00:52:17,188 --> 00:52:18,430
Leave me alone!

1050
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:20,311
No!

1051
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:21,615
Look,

1052
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,880
the pussy wants to play.

1053
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,838
I can see it in her eyes.

1054
00:52:25,863 --> 00:52:28,560
I think she loves you.

1055
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,840
I think so too.

1056
00:52:31,263 --> 00:52:32,800
C'mere, little pussy.

1057
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,040
just one kiss for your lover!

1058
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,980
Keep your filthy paws off me!

1059
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,480
Help!

1060
00:52:40,512 --> 00:52:44,000
Seems she left her magic stick at home.

1061
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,160
Don't worry,

1062
00:52:45,185 --> 00:52:48,000
I've got one down here for you!

1063
00:52:59,513 --> 00:53:02,200
By the gods, are you okay?

1064
00:53:04,843 --> 00:53:05,898
Yes,

1065
00:53:06,706 --> 00:53:07,957
I'm fine.

1066
00:53:13,054 --> 00:53:13,880
It's okay.

1067
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:15,600
You're safe now.

1068
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:18,240
Those two aren't going
to bother you ever again.

1069
00:53:18,546 --> 00:53:19,680
Thanks.

1070
00:53:20,082 --> 00:53:22,280
You're lucky that Greenfield
saw you sneaking out,

1071
00:53:22,305 --> 00:53:25,120
Otherwise I wouldn't have
known where to find you.

1072
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,390
I'm so sorry.

1073
00:53:27,724 --> 00:53:29,204
Oh, my little kitty.

1074
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:31,673
When are you going to learn?

1075
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:34,995
Being a princess means
a lot of responsibility.

1076
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:38,245
I'm sorry too that Quicksilver is gone, but

1077
00:53:38,658 --> 00:53:41,178
now it's up to you to rule this city.

1078
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:43,600
I can't do it, Whisper.

1079
00:53:43,771 --> 00:53:46,087
I just can't do it.

1080
00:53:46,112 --> 00:53:48,280
If you manage to survive
just one more night,

1081
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,320
you won't have to carry
this burden alone anymore.

1082
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,244
I promise I will be there for
you until death do us part.

1083
00:53:57,712 --> 00:53:58,752
My lady,

1084
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,360
I'm neither a soldier nor a wizard.

1085
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:04,960
To ensure your personal safety,

1086
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:09,960
I would kindly request that you coordinate
any nightly excursions with me first.

1087
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:12,040
Are you putting me under arrest?

1088
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:13,575
Of course not.

1089
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:17,807
How am I supposed to
take care of my city when I'm

1090
00:54:17,832 --> 00:54:20,885
locked up at the palace
like a scourge in a museum?

1091
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:25,960
I need to be out here with the
people in the city I grew up in.

1092
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,236
I can't believe this is
coming from the same

1093
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:31,200
woman who nearly got
raped five minutes ago.

1094
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:34,320
Would you have preferred
we hadn't come for you?

1095
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,680
I know I made a mistake.

1096
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:38,880
And of course, I'm glad you came.

1097
00:54:39,138 --> 00:54:40,895
Next time I'll be more careful.

1098
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:42,798
That won't be enough.

1099
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:44,640
Ironforge has changed.

1100
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:47,080
A lot of people want your throne.

1101
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,641
It might change when we can
finally build our own firearms,

1102
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:52,080
but until then it's not safe out here.

1103
00:54:52,108 --> 00:54:54,217
Weapons, weapons, weapons!

1104
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:57,948
For you, it's all about weapons!

1105
00:54:57,973 --> 00:55:00,320
Everyone's going at each other's throats.

1106
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,371
Chaos.

1107
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:02,560
Anarchy.

1108
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,880
Building our own firearms will be
the only way to ensure our freedom.

1109
00:55:07,457 --> 00:55:09,865
But instead of giving us
the blueprints we need,

1110
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,781
the Institute keeps them locked up in their
ivory tower just like the Keepers did.

1111
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
I know.

1112
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:20,388
Then please tell me why I just had
to save the woman who owns the

1113
00:55:20,413 --> 00:55:24,120
most powerful killing device
on this side of the Serpent River?

1114
00:55:24,232 --> 00:55:27,120
Because this place is a sanctuary.

1115
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:28,840
I came here to grieve,

1116
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:30,174
not to kill.

1117
00:55:34,294 --> 00:55:35,358
I'm sorry.

1118
00:55:36,456 --> 00:55:38,120
You could have died tonight.

1119
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,376
I was worried.

1120
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:41,608
You're right.

1121
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,736
I should have been more careful.

1122
00:55:45,152 --> 00:55:46,480
Do you still love me?

1123
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:47,920
Of course I do.

1124
00:55:48,965 --> 00:55:50,560
I know I love you too.

1125
00:55:52,608 --> 00:55:54,368
Now you go home with the guards.

1126
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,216
I'll stay here with Greenfield
and clean up this mess, alright?

1127
00:55:57,566 --> 00:56:00,240
The last thing we want is a public outrage.

1128
00:56:00,312 --> 00:56:01,312
Alright.

1129
00:56:01,502 --> 00:56:02,805
Good night, my love.

1130
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,657
Good night.

1131
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:14,791
Greenfield,

1132
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,668
let's get these bodies out of sight.

1133
00:56:18,465 --> 00:56:20,335
We'll drop them by the
mortuary, so the Undertaker

1134
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,400
can take care of them
tomorrow morning.

1135
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,448
You take the arms,

1136
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,777
I'll take the legs.

1137
00:56:24,857 --> 00:56:25,880
Yes, sir.

1138
00:56:28,493 --> 00:56:30,361
Heavy bastard.

1139
00:56:31,249 --> 00:56:32,929
How ironic.

1140
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:35,100
Shot in a cemetery.

1141
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:43,713
I hate killing people in public places.

1142
00:56:44,183 --> 00:56:47,243
So many precious lives lost every day.

1143
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:49,271
It's a tragedy.

1144
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:54,575
You know,

1145
00:56:54,606 --> 00:56:56,920
the worst thing is the paperwork.

1146
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,120
They want to know everything.

1147
00:56:59,232 --> 00:56:59,912
Why,

1148
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:00,711
how,

1149
00:57:00,871 --> 00:57:01,871
when,

1150
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:04,539
where.

1151
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:09,280
Once I'm Lord of Ironforge,

1152
00:57:09,368 --> 00:57:11,451
this will get so much simpler.

1153
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:14,071
I beg your pardon, sir?

1154
00:57:15,556 --> 00:57:17,971
The city needs a proper lord again.

1155
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:20,152
Goldeneyes is just too sensitive,

1156
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:21,673
too soft.

1157
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,240
You know what I mean?

1158
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,159
I'm not entirely sure I do, sir.

1159
00:57:26,184 --> 00:57:29,760
And I still don't get why
she didn't bring her gun.

1160
00:57:29,952 --> 00:57:32,932
I mean, I know the whole
killing business is not her thing,

1161
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:36,089
but she knows how
dangerous it is out here at night.

1162
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,840
Yes, sir.

1163
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:42,880
Very peculiar, sir.

1164
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,793
Stop playing dumb, Greenfield.

1165
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:50,328
She doesn't have it anymore, am I right?

1166
00:57:50,488 --> 00:57:52,808
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

1167
00:57:52,952 --> 00:57:54,512
Oh, look how late it is.

1168
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,080
I have to be right back.

1169
00:57:59,232 --> 00:58:02,127
Greenfield.

1170
00:58:03,223 --> 00:58:04,063
Please,

1171
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,360
sir.

1172
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,640
If I tell you this,

1173
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,066
she's going to shoot me.

1174
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,960
Greenfield.

1175
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:15,049
First of all,

1176
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,800
you just gave it away.

1177
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:18,759
Secondly,

1178
00:58:18,784 --> 00:58:19,880
how?

1179
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,470
I'm sorry, sir.

1180
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,188
I'm not very good at politics.

1181
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:27,600
That's fine, Greenfield.

1182
00:58:27,744 --> 00:58:29,800
Just tell me what you know.

1183
00:58:29,896 --> 00:58:32,176
Where is the gun?

1184
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,920
It was stolen.

1185
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,040
What?

1186
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:38,200
How the hell did that happen?

1187
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:42,127
Someone took it from a
study and left without a trace.

1188
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,520
And even stranger,

1189
00:58:43,803 --> 00:58:45,372
the bullets are still there.

1190
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:46,640
And when was that?

1191
00:58:47,347 --> 00:58:49,147
The day after the execution.

1192
00:58:50,168 --> 00:58:51,168
The spy?

1193
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,280
Yes,

1194
00:58:52,312 --> 00:58:53,999
the pig, sir.

1195
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,043
Anyways,

1196
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,720
bullets are no bullets,

1197
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,364
We need to get that gun back.

1198
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,690
Greenfield,

1199
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,223
go and see after her.

1200
00:59:03,185 --> 00:59:04,839
I'll be with you in a moment.

1201
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:05,811
Yes,

1202
00:59:06,022 --> 00:59:07,022
sir.

1203
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,927
Oh, Quicksilver, my old friend.

1204
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,183
You were always so idealistic,

1205
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,688
so courageous,

1206
00:59:20,784 --> 00:59:22,227
and so wrong.

1207
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:25,640
Ironforge could be
the capital of the world,

1208
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:28,960
but you never realized that.

1209
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,789
What am I supposed to do with your lady?

1210
00:59:32,824 --> 00:59:34,972
She's becoming a
serious threat to my plans.

1211
00:59:35,663 --> 00:59:37,520
Any ideas?

1212
00:59:37,584 --> 00:59:38,624
No.

1213
00:59:39,197 --> 00:59:40,197
Thought so.

1214
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,720
Sorry for invading your
family like that, old chap.

1215
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:46,840
But if that's what it takes to
make Ironforge great again,

1216
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:48,508
it has to be done.

1217
00:59:50,245 --> 00:59:51,860
Oh, wait.

1218
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:53,395
Family.

1219
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:56,247
That's how it all makes sense.

1220
00:59:56,768 --> 00:59:57,646
Quicksilver,

1221
00:59:57,737 --> 01:00:00,000
as much as I enjoyed this conversation,

1222
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:02,205
I have to take my leave.

1223
01:00:38,515 --> 01:00:39,295
That's it.

1224
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,840
I'm done for today.

1225
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,120
It's getting dark and my paws hurt.

1226
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,072
How about you?

1227
01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:46,280
There's something under this rock.

1228
01:00:46,391 --> 01:00:47,960
I can hear it.

1229
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,955
Maybe it's a bunker or
a secret weapons stash.

1230
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,440
Hah! Dream on.

1231
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:55,240
Shut up and help me pry this thing open.

1232
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,224
Okay, but this'll be the
last thing I'll do for tonight.

1233
01:01:03,412 --> 01:01:04,415
There.

1234
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:05,615
An opening.

1235
01:01:06,473 --> 01:01:07,684
I knew it!

1236
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,120
And?

1237
01:01:09,506 --> 01:01:10,721
Can you see something?

1238
01:01:10,746 --> 01:01:12,280
It's full of water.

1239
01:01:12,305 --> 01:01:13,249
Of course.

1240
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,400
What did you expect?

1241
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,480
I have to find out what's in there.

1242
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:17,720
No, be careful!

1243
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,080
You don't know how deep it is.

1244
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,010
I am an otter, stupid!

1245
01:01:24,286 --> 01:01:25,600
Oh damn it!

1246
01:01:25,689 --> 01:01:26,480
What is it?

1247
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,320
Nothing down here but slimy debris.

1248
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,377
Not exactly unusual for the
ruins of a 500-year-old war zone.

1249
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:35,087
Smartass.

1250
01:01:35,198 --> 01:01:38,040
Wait, what is this?

1251
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,249
A box?

1252
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,742
Yes.

1253
01:01:41,837 --> 01:01:43,506
A small metal crate.

1254
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:45,200
And wow,

1255
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,520
it's much lighter than I thought.

1256
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,440
Yeah, that probably means it's empty.

1257
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,320
Empty means there's no water in it.

1258
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,920
This might be our lucky day, pal.

1259
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,360
I'll believe it when I see it.

1260
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,402
Bring it up here.

1261
01:01:57,427 --> 01:02:00,440
Oh, suddenly you're
all interested again!

1262
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,928
Here, catch!

1263
01:02:04,452 --> 01:02:05,440
Hmm.

1264
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,680
It's made of this super
light metal that doesn't rust.

1265
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,724
That alone is going to fetch a good price.

1266
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:13,600
The lock was apparently made of iron.

1267
01:02:13,712 --> 01:02:15,015
It's almost completely gone.

1268
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,320
What are you waiting for?

1269
01:02:18,345 --> 01:02:19,614
Open it!

1270
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,560
Oh, my goodness, you were right.

1271
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,520
This is our lucky day!

1272
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,480
Now look what we have here.

1273
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,680
It's a pistol! And matching bullets!

1274
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,280
In the best condition I've ever seen.

1275
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:38,367
Barely any rust.

1276
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:43,219
And it just works after so many centuries.

1277
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:44,529
How crazy is that?

1278
01:02:44,576 --> 01:02:47,516
The humans made the most amazing materials.

1279
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,080
This thing is worth a fortune.

1280
01:02:49,124 --> 01:02:50,840
We should bring it to the Institute.

1281
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,480
No! Are you nuts?

1282
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,652
All they're going to
do is confiscate it

1283
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:57,094
and lock it up with the
thousands they already have.

1284
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,000
And pay a very good reward.

1285
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,917
That is nothing compared to
what the Opposition would pay.

1286
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:04,520
But that would be totally irresponsible!

1287
01:03:05,134 --> 01:03:06,295
Says the grave robber.

1288
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,677
This weapon is not some
ancient human trinket.

1289
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,480
If you're not going to report it,

1290
01:03:10,563 --> 01:03:11,373
I will!

1291
01:03:11,627 --> 01:03:14,640
In the wrong hands,
it could kill hundreds of people,

1292
01:03:14,717 --> 01:03:16,090
if not thousands.

1293
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:17,160
Thousands?

1294
01:03:17,744 --> 01:03:18,980
You're exaggerating.

1295
01:03:19,617 --> 01:03:22,247
Just one is enough.

1296
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,320
What do you mean?

1297
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:29,400
I told you the Sea of
Debris is a dangerous place.

1298
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,160
I would have shared with you.

1299
01:03:31,228 --> 01:03:33,634
Too bad you'd rather die than be rich.

1300
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,560
Farewell, my friend.

1301
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,669
And rest in peace.

1302
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,240
Oh finally, we're getting
out of this damn forest.

1303
01:04:21,304 --> 01:04:23,421
I still have no idea where we are, but

1304
01:04:23,889 --> 01:04:25,000
where there's a road,

1305
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:26,649
there must be a destination.

1306
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,200
This must be one of the old
roads that the humans built.

1307
01:04:30,256 --> 01:04:32,000
Hm, what makes you think that?

1308
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,897
Well, because it's made of concrete.

1309
01:04:34,064 --> 01:04:36,756
Oh, well, a good thing
it's not made of abstract.

1310
01:04:37,796 --> 01:04:38,916
Very funny.

1311
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:41,633
Concrete is a sort of man-made rock.

1312
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,600
They used it to build houses
and roads and bridges.

1313
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,320
Everything that needed
to last centuries or longer.

1314
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:48,567
Like this road here.

1315
01:04:49,613 --> 01:04:52,093
You're like a walking lexiclopedia.

1316
01:04:53,847 --> 01:04:55,883
It's encyclopedia.

1317
01:04:58,134 --> 01:05:00,334
You're so cute when
you try to talk like me.

1318
01:05:02,939 --> 01:05:04,600
Don't you think we make a great team?

1319
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:07,080
I'm all theory and you're all practice.

1320
01:05:07,448 --> 01:05:12,911
I think you mean I do all the heavy
lifting and you won't stop talking, huh?

1321
01:05:14,807 --> 01:05:15,969
I need a break.

1322
01:05:16,158 --> 01:05:18,598
My back is killing me.

1323
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,249
Well, then

1324
01:05:21,493 --> 01:05:23,153
come over here and

1325
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:25,320
sit down for a moment.

1326
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,280
What for?

1327
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,364
Just do it, ok?

1328
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:28,654
Okay.

1329
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:34,789
What?

1330
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:43,646
Oh, that's good!

1331
01:05:44,242 --> 01:05:45,895
Please don't stop.

1332
01:05:45,951 --> 01:05:48,840
See, I'm not all that useless, am I?

1333
01:05:48,865 --> 01:05:51,592
Wow! Your muscles are really tense.

1334
01:05:54,636 --> 01:05:56,305
If it hurts, tell me, ok?

1335
01:05:56,766 --> 01:05:59,596
I don't think that you can even hurt me.

1336
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:01,160
Sorry, sorry!

1337
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:02,756
No, no, no.

1338
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,840
Go on.

1339
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,200
It hurts, but it hurts so good!

1340
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:08,510
Okay.

1341
01:06:12,216 --> 01:06:13,560
You know what?

1342
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:16,560
I've never felt safer than with you around.

1343
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:19,521
And I usually don't trust people easily.

1344
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:22,600
Really?

1345
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,320
But you know so much about the world!

1346
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:29,020
I have learned more from you
than from any other class before.

1347
01:06:29,508 --> 01:06:33,207
And at school, you were the only
one who didn't make fun of me.

1348
01:06:33,382 --> 01:06:35,190
That means a lot to me.

1349
01:06:35,754 --> 01:06:37,055
Well, you're lucky then.

1350
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,410
It seems we are stuck
with each other for a while.

1351
01:06:40,736 --> 01:06:42,720
It could be a lot worse, right?

1352
01:06:42,872 --> 01:06:43,872
Yeah, sure could.

1353
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:47,197
By the way, I'm getting hungry.

1354
01:06:47,456 --> 01:06:50,376
I could really go for a piece
of roasted pigrat right now.

1355
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:52,520
Is there any left?

1356
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:53,840
Oh, thank you.

1357
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:54,935
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

1358
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,520
There should be plenty left.

1359
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,640
It's ra...

1360
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,747
Where the hell did my bag go?

1361
01:07:02,022 --> 01:07:03,440
Uh, what?

1362
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,120
I could swear I put it right here.

1363
01:07:07,268 --> 01:07:08,762
I can still smell it.

1364
01:07:12,536 --> 01:07:16,360
Oh, by the way, these are the
remnants of an old communication system

1365
01:07:16,385 --> 01:07:19,400
that was ancient even by human standards.

1366
01:07:19,472 --> 01:07:20,880
And it was used to...

1367
01:07:21,531 --> 01:07:22,559
People could...

1368
01:07:27,019 --> 01:07:28,082
Uh-huh.

1369
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,720
I think I found a thief.

1370
01:07:31,057 --> 01:07:33,320
Hey, I know you're in there.

1371
01:07:33,419 --> 01:07:35,220
Give us our food back!

1372
01:07:38,404 --> 01:07:39,920
Hey there, open up!

1373
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,720
Okay, you want trouble?

1374
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,320
You can get trouble!

1375
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:54,429
I am going to huff and
puff and shake this...

1376
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,800
We give up.

1377
01:07:56,902 --> 01:07:58,061
Here's your food!

1378
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:03,320
What?

1379
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,160
There's barely half of it left.

1380
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,391
You thieves!

1381
01:08:08,591 --> 01:08:09,922
Have mercy.

1382
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:12,015
It's hard to get by these days.

1383
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,015
So hard!

1384
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:16,779
We've been living on
nothing but grubs today.

1385
01:08:16,804 --> 01:08:18,200
And yesterday.

1386
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:19,800
And tomorrow.

1387
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:21,056
Now that didn't make any sense.

1388
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,080
Of course it didn't.

1389
01:08:23,092 --> 01:08:25,088
Then you brought pig rats.

1390
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,258
So tasty!

1391
01:08:27,282 --> 01:08:29,254
Soooo tasty!

1392
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,292
Soooooooooo tasty!

1393
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:32,689
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo...

1394
01:08:32,714 --> 01:08:34,421
STOP!

1395
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:36,547
I think we got the message.

1396
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:39,640
So you're living in this...

1397
01:08:39,732 --> 01:08:40,640
thing?

1398
01:08:40,672 --> 01:08:41,360
Phone booth.

1399
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:42,200
Ah, whatever.

1400
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,640
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1401
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,960
Most definitely, yes.

1402
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,480
Always have.

1403
01:08:46,544 --> 01:08:48,069
Always will.

1404
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:50,225
Um, then you can tell
me where we are, right?

1405
01:08:50,313 --> 01:08:51,440
Of course!

1406
01:08:51,575 --> 01:08:52,920
Why do you even ask?

1407
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,152
It's so obvious!

1408
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:57,800
Okay,

1409
01:08:58,499 --> 01:08:59,480
then, okay.

1410
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,880
Where are we?

1411
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:03,320
You are no longer where you came from.

1412
01:09:03,423 --> 01:09:05,160
You're not yet where you're going.

1413
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,760
Right now, you are right here.

1414
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,201
Are you making fun of us?

1415
01:09:12,032 --> 01:09:12,912
Are you?

1416
01:09:13,137 --> 01:09:14,006
No.

1417
01:09:14,054 --> 01:09:15,040
Are you?

1418
01:09:15,093 --> 01:09:15,520
No.

1419
01:09:15,566 --> 01:09:16,640
Are you?

1420
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,880
I don't think we are.

1421
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:26,400
Now listen to me.

1422
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,716
Do you see this guy over there?

1423
01:09:29,088 --> 01:09:30,088
Hi.

1424
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,120
That is Raindancer.

1425
01:09:32,303 --> 01:09:34,581
And he knows how to set things on fire.

1426
01:09:37,933 --> 01:09:40,720
This includes that funny
chicken shed of yours.

1427
01:09:40,792 --> 01:09:41,928
Um, phone booth.

1428
01:09:42,832 --> 01:09:45,720
So if you want to see
the light of another day,

1429
01:09:45,772 --> 01:09:47,748
you better stop playing games with me!

1430
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:49,320
Do you hear me, Mr.

1431
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,440
Rubber Chicken?

1432
01:09:50,913 --> 01:09:52,520
I'm not a rubber chicken.

1433
01:09:57,476 --> 01:09:59,311
I wonder if they taste like one.

1434
01:09:59,438 --> 01:10:01,257
All right, all right.

1435
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,440
You win.

1436
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:03,639
We lose.

1437
01:10:05,516 --> 01:10:07,680
My neck pain! It's gone!

1438
01:10:08,645 --> 01:10:10,520
One last time.

1439
01:10:10,584 --> 01:10:12,200
Where are we?

1440
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,440
You are on the road to Ironforge.

1441
01:10:14,526 --> 01:10:16,720
The glorious capital of the Iron Land.

1442
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:21,840
The city of milk and pancakes!

1443
01:10:21,865 --> 01:10:23,545
Ironforge!

1444
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,680
Now that makes a lot of sense.

1445
01:10:25,744 --> 01:10:27,101
The idiot on the carriage,

1446
01:10:27,283 --> 01:10:29,400
he mentioned Lady Goldeneyes.

1447
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,335
Oh,

1448
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,440
the wonderful Lady Goldeneyes!

1449
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,175
Princess of Ironforge!

1450
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,744
Her eyes are so golden!

1451
01:10:38,184 --> 01:10:39,024
So

1452
01:10:39,273 --> 01:10:41,400
That's where they've
been trying to take us.

1453
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:44,233
And that must be where
the other students are.

1454
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,168
We should go immediately back
to Ferndale and tell everybody.

1455
01:10:47,193 --> 01:10:48,000
No,

1456
01:10:48,089 --> 01:10:51,000
we must go to Ironforge
and save the students.

1457
01:10:51,536 --> 01:10:52,960
And how are we supposed to do that?

1458
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:54,600
With no weapons and no backup?

1459
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,880
No nothing?

1460
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,520
No, no, no, no, no.

1461
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,280
You should definitely not go to Ironforge!

1462
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:02,240
Everyone wants the Lady's throne!

1463
01:11:02,265 --> 01:11:03,200
It's not safe!

1464
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:06,560
She won't last long, that's for sure!

1465
01:11:06,824 --> 01:11:09,640
And how do you think we
should go back to Ferndale?

1466
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:10,920
On foot?

1467
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,280
That will take at least a week
and it's still pretty dangerous.

1468
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:15,840
Oh, yes!

1469
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,040
The woods are where the snapjaw lives!

1470
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,154
Nasty snappy bitey creatures!

1471
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:23,160
But the pigrats are so tasty!

1472
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:24,208
Birds,

1473
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,160
can you please make up your mind?

1474
01:11:26,256 --> 01:11:27,376
You're not helping.

1475
01:11:27,611 --> 01:11:28,091
Yes.

1476
01:11:28,116 --> 01:11:28,440
No.

1477
01:11:28,465 --> 01:11:29,465
Maybe?

1478
01:11:32,306 --> 01:11:33,400
Rainy,

1479
01:11:33,472 --> 01:11:34,724
hand me the lighter.

1480
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:36,622
Look,

1481
01:11:36,647 --> 01:11:37,374
look!

1482
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:39,149
Someone is coming up the road!

1483
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:40,000
Stranger danger!

1484
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,400
We must hide!

1485
01:11:43,297 --> 01:11:45,294
Should we hide too?

1486
01:11:46,882 --> 01:11:47,959
It's too late.

1487
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:49,504
We need to disguise.

1488
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,907
Just play along, okay?

1489
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:51,843
Ok!

1490
01:12:05,324 --> 01:12:07,720
Oh, lookie there!

1491
01:12:07,978 --> 01:12:10,349
Isn't there a more
beautiful sight than the

1492
01:12:10,374 --> 01:12:14,045
flowering of new love
in the time of spring?

1493
01:12:17,213 --> 01:12:19,536
That was more like a deflowering!

1494
01:12:24,084 --> 01:12:25,165
Oh, hello there.

1495
01:12:25,443 --> 01:12:26,735
Oh, I'm sorry.

1496
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,705
We really didn't expect
anyone to come by so suddenly.

1497
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,800
Oh, don't mind me.

1498
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:38,785
I am just a dirty old man
thinking about the time long ago.

1499
01:12:45,169 --> 01:12:45,975
Well,

1500
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,852
my name is, ummm...

1501
01:12:47,987 --> 01:12:51,932
Daisypuff, and this is my fiancée, er...

1502
01:12:51,957 --> 01:12:52,939
Talksalot.

1503
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:01,480
I hate you.

1504
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,073
I'm an old man and yeah,

1505
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,120
you know,

1506
01:13:05,596 --> 01:13:06,640
my ears are not so good.

1507
01:13:06,665 --> 01:13:09,000
How are your names? Excuse me...

1508
01:13:10,163 --> 01:13:14,880
Daisypuff it was.
And my fiancée Talksalot.

1509
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,400
Talksalot, yeah.

1510
01:13:17,195 --> 01:13:20,680
My name is Amberleaves, and
Ironforge is my humble home.

1511
01:13:20,758 --> 01:13:23,916
I haven't seen you two around here before?

1512
01:13:24,163 --> 01:13:26,080
We are pleased to make your acquaintance.

1513
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,019
Pleased to make your acquaintance too.

1514
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:35,640
Oh, well, isn't this a strange coincidence?

1515
01:13:35,962 --> 01:13:38,874
We were just taking a
break on our way to Ironforge.

1516
01:13:40,028 --> 01:13:41,782
Do you think you could give us a ride?

1517
01:13:41,807 --> 01:13:43,280
Of course I can.

1518
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:48,280
Is this your first time to Ironforge?
And right on time for the big celebration!

1519
01:13:48,305 --> 01:13:49,040
Oh, really?

1520
01:13:49,444 --> 01:13:53,080
Yes, Lady Goldeneyes
is going to get married.

1521
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,609
After so many years,

1522
01:13:54,634 --> 01:13:58,628
Ironforge is finally getting to
have a proper royal couple again.

1523
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,920
The entire town is
throwing a one big party.

1524
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,280
You should definitely go and see it.

1525
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,560
Oh, of course.

1526
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,280
I love weddings!

1527
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,600
But when we arrive at Ironforge,

1528
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,084
first thing we do is look for help, okay?

1529
01:14:14,442 --> 01:14:16,800
Uncle Brushy used to have
some good friends in Ironforge.

1530
01:14:16,825 --> 01:14:18,140
One of them is Longleaf,

1531
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,520
a very nice fellow.

1532
01:14:19,578 --> 01:14:21,736
As far as I know, he runs a bakery there.

1533
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,341
We'll find him and then we'll tell the
Institute and let them handle everything.

1534
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:28,880
And then we can enjoy
the celebration, okay?

1535
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:30,423
Awwww, okay.

1536
01:14:31,507 --> 01:14:32,888
Before we go,

1537
01:14:33,404 --> 01:14:35,788
I have one humble request.

1538
01:14:35,974 --> 01:14:40,600
You see, my horse is thirsty
and there is a little stream nearby.

1539
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:41,880
Daisypuff,

1540
01:14:41,905 --> 01:14:44,520
could you help me getting some water?

1541
01:14:44,598 --> 01:14:47,960
It's just a short walk.
And you, Talksalot,

1542
01:14:48,023 --> 01:14:51,776
Maybe you could stay here
and keep an eye on old Patsy?

1543
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:53,078
Oh, sure.

1544
01:14:53,158 --> 01:14:54,720
Of course. Sure.

1545
01:14:54,808 --> 01:14:55,808
No problem.

1546
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:00,880
Easy, easy.

1547
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,120
He's going to be back very soon.

1548
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:04,080
Easy.

1549
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,760
There you go.

1550
01:15:05,854 --> 01:15:07,745
I know who you are, Potami.

1551
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:11,466
Shh.

1552
01:15:12,338 --> 01:15:13,600
Don't worry.

1553
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:14,680
I'm your friend.

1554
01:15:15,672 --> 01:15:17,912
It seems we both have a
common enemy, and I'm

1555
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:21,080
going to make you an offer
that you will appreciate.

1556
01:15:21,755 --> 01:15:23,435
I'm sure!

1557
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,520
It's right here in this bag.

1558
01:15:26,612 --> 01:15:28,582
Let's talk about it while we walk, and...

1559
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,480
no word to the other guy, okay?

1560
01:15:32,689 --> 01:15:35,294
This will be our little secret.

1561
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:55,359
Goldeneyes! Wake up, honey.

1562
01:15:55,486 --> 01:15:56,158
Wake up!

1563
01:15:56,183 --> 01:15:57,440
Quicksilver?

1564
01:15:58,207 --> 01:15:59,243
What is it?

1565
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,440
I have to leave.

1566
01:16:00,536 --> 01:16:01,280
Now?

1567
01:16:01,502 --> 01:16:02,909
In the middle of the night?

1568
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,400
Someone blew the whistle.

1569
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,800
The Keepers are after me.

1570
01:16:05,885 --> 01:16:07,606
Greenfield is trying to stall them, but

1571
01:16:07,662 --> 01:16:09,120
I don't have much time.

1572
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,200
Please tell me that's a joke.

1573
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,720
I wish it were.

1574
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:15,040
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1575
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:17,946
I... I told you not to
deal with the Rebels, but...

1576
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:18,760
but you...

1577
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,374
you goddamn bastard!

1578
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:24,400
Don't... Don't cry.

1579
01:16:24,817 --> 01:16:26,680
When they get you, they will kill you!

1580
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,280
I won't let that happen.

1581
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,520
I promise!

1582
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,720
But I really have to go now.

1583
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:32,948
Go where?

1584
01:16:32,973 --> 01:16:34,040
To Camp Freedom,

1585
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,200
the secret base at the Rebel Underground.

1586
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,015
You are joining them?

1587
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,040
It's now or never.

1588
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,166
But I love you!

1589
01:16:40,206 --> 01:16:42,215
You can't just leave me like that!

1590
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,720
I love you, too.

1591
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,520
But right now, it's my
only chance to survive.

1592
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,640
And I'll be back!

1593
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,480
I promise.

1594
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,480
What about Ironforge?

1595
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,280
Who's going to run this
city while you're away?

1596
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:54,920
You're the Princess.

1597
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:55,880
Have you forgotten that?

1598
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,200
I can't do this without you!

1599
01:16:58,225 --> 01:16:59,760
Oh, yes, you can.

1600
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,600
You know a lot more about
ruling this city than anybody else.

1601
01:17:03,693 --> 01:17:05,800
And it will only be for a short time.

1602
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:08,120
Stormrunner has an excellent plan.

1603
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,080
You will see.

1604
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:12,338
The tyranny of the Keepers
will be over very soon.

1605
01:17:12,473 --> 01:17:15,400
I'm sorry, but these are the
Lord's and Lady's private rooms!

1606
01:17:15,491 --> 01:17:17,400
I cannot let you enter without permission!

1607
01:17:17,489 --> 01:17:20,200
I'm sorry, too, but your
permission is irrelevant!

1608
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:24,935
Oh, for the God's sake,

1609
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,720
get me that door open!

1610
01:17:26,984 --> 01:17:27,899
Damn!

1611
01:17:27,924 --> 01:17:29,480
I've spent too much time talking.

1612
01:17:29,572 --> 01:17:30,600
I have to leave!

1613
01:17:32,432 --> 01:17:33,720
Through the window?

1614
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:35,561
There's no other way.

1615
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,160
I love your, Goldeneyes.

1616
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,785
I'll see you after the revolution.

1617
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,021
Quicksilver!

1618
01:17:46,188 --> 01:17:47,132
All right.

1619
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:47,997
Where is he?

1620
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,055
Talk to me, woman.

1621
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,600
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.

1622
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,720
The window!

1623
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,640
Damn, there he goes!

1624
01:17:55,695 --> 01:17:57,760
Why in the God's name is nobody down there?

1625
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,320
Don't stare at me like that.

1626
01:17:59,345 --> 01:18:00,345
Run, get him!

1627
01:18:14,476 --> 01:18:15,444
There we are.

1628
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:22,117
The marketplace. If there's one place we find
friends of the Institute, then it's here.

1629
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:27,240
So many people, and everyone is
wearing their finest for the big ceremony.

1630
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,760
Huh, look around for anybody
wearing the Tree of Knowledge.

1631
01:18:29,858 --> 01:18:33,150
Oh, I wonder what kind of dress
Lady Goldeneyes is going to wear.

1632
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:34,815
Forget the wedding for a moment.

1633
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,648
We must find Longleaf first.

1634
01:18:36,673 --> 01:18:37,506
Ooooh,

1635
01:18:37,752 --> 01:18:41,880
but I've never seen a royal
wedding before in my whole life!

1636
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:47,000
How about you stay here and keep
searching and I watch the ceremony?

1637
01:18:47,048 --> 01:18:48,745
I'm sure it won't take long.

1638
01:18:50,339 --> 01:18:53,039
It's not like I'll be able to
stop you anyway, right?

1639
01:18:53,321 --> 01:18:54,360
Damn straight!

1640
01:18:54,784 --> 01:18:56,320
I'll be at the front.

1641
01:18:56,872 --> 01:18:57,800
Be safe.

1642
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,080
OK.

1643
01:18:59,104 --> 01:19:00,144
Be safe?

1644
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:02,203
Why would I not?

1645
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:04,770
Ok, whatever.

1646
01:19:14,265 --> 01:19:16,400
Hear ye, hear ye.

1647
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:20,200
Thank you very much to all for your
presence and affection on this day.

1648
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:21,948
Windsor Whisperwind,

1649
01:19:21,996 --> 01:19:26,264
the city's wealthiest entrepreneur
and long-time consultant to the house,

1650
01:19:26,565 --> 01:19:30,280
receive the hand of our
beloved Lady Goldeneyes,

1651
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:32,898
Princess of Ironforge!

1652
01:19:47,834 --> 01:19:49,600
My dearest Goldeneyes,

1653
01:19:50,387 --> 01:19:54,546
many may believe that it was a
fairy tale the way we came together.

1654
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,960
And of course,

1655
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,080
they are right.

1656
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,179
It is always a fairy
tale the way two people

1657
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:02,720
come together and
decide to share life.

1658
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:06,880
Yes, indeed, you are
the Princess of Ironforge,

1659
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,640
but this cannot separate you
from which you also represent.

1660
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:14,320
You are built by your
heritage and your role,

1661
01:20:14,414 --> 01:20:17,059
which makes you the person you are today,

1662
01:20:17,274 --> 01:20:20,440
ripe and ready for the tasks
you have chosen in your life.

1663
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,470
We see you as the revelation
of sincerity and diligence.

1664
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,832
And during the time we
have known each other,

1665
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:30,599
I have constantly been thinking of this:

1666
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,880
Are we really meant for each other?

1667
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:36,500
Then fate will surely
arrange it all to the best.

1668
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:43,600
The promise made today

1669
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:48,037
and the ties that are bound here
will greatly strengthen your union.

1670
01:20:48,879 --> 01:20:52,595
They will cross the years
and lives of each soul's growth.

1671
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,846
Do you still seek to enter the ceremony?

1672
01:20:57,184 --> 01:20:58,015
Yes,

1673
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,742
we seek to enter.

1674
01:21:01,138 --> 01:21:02,258
Whisperwind,

1675
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,480
will you cause her pain?

1676
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,760
I may.

1677
01:21:05,785 --> 01:21:07,345
Is that your intent?

1678
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,560
No.

1679
01:21:10,622 --> 01:21:11,712
Goldeneyes,

1680
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:13,831
will you cause him pain?

1681
01:21:13,864 --> 01:21:15,344
I may.

1682
01:21:15,456 --> 01:21:16,972
Is that your intent?

1683
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,107
No.

1684
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:22,706
Will both of you share each
other's pain and seek to ease it?

1685
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,480
Yes, we will.

1686
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:28,600
Above you are the stars.

1687
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:30,644
Below you are the stones.

1688
01:21:31,588 --> 01:21:32,880
As time passes,

1689
01:21:32,961 --> 01:21:34,240
remember,

1690
01:21:34,429 --> 01:21:37,224
like the stone, your love should be firm.

1691
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,190
Like the stars, your
love should be constant.

1692
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,737
Let the strength of your
wills bind you together.

1693
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,663
You may now kiss.

1694
01:21:56,535 --> 01:22:03,879
Let it be known that Whisperwind and Goldeneyes
are now Lord and Lady of Ironforge!

1695
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:15,267
Potami! Potami! No! No!

1696
01:22:15,354 --> 01:22:17,863
This one is for my mother!

1697
01:22:22,278 --> 01:22:24,343
Potami! You don't know...

1698
01:22:26,266 --> 01:22:27,670
You don't know what you're doing!

1699
01:22:28,781 --> 01:22:32,804
I told you not to come after me!
Now you've ruined everything!

1700
01:22:32,852 --> 01:22:34,420
What the hell did you just do?

1701
01:22:34,499 --> 01:22:35,871
I made history!

1702
01:22:35,896 --> 01:22:36,924
What?

1703
01:22:37,465 --> 01:22:38,567
Run!

1704
01:22:39,602 --> 01:22:40,782
Don't talk! Run!

1705
01:22:40,807 --> 01:22:42,280
What the...

1706
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:45,612
Guards! Why are there no guards?

1707
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,720
Come after them, you fools!

1708
01:22:49,459 --> 01:22:50,735
Oh, shit!

1709
01:22:51,052 --> 01:22:52,648
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

1710
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:56,320
The assassins are fleeing! Cease them!

1711
01:22:56,837 --> 01:22:58,000
Oh, come on!

1712
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,345
Come on the horse!

1713
01:23:02,995 --> 01:23:05,247
Hold on! It's going to be a bumpy ride!

1714
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:24,522
Who is there?

1715
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,000
It's me, Whisperwind.

1716
01:23:26,025 --> 01:23:26,930
Oh.

1717
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,680
To what do I owe the honor
of this unexpected visit?

1718
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,040
Oh, I just happened to be nearby,

1719
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,160
and I thought, why not pay
the old hammerfist a visit?

1720
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,000
Well, it's always a pleasure
to welcome a good customer,

1721
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,680
but I'm sure you're not
here for some idle chatter.

1722
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,200
You know me too well.

1723
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,960
How is the work on the gun going?

1724
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,080
Well, we...

1725
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:51,520
I don't think we can do it.

1726
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,720
This is not what I wanted to hear.

1727
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,640
I know, but I'm an honest man,

1728
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,520
so I'm telling you like it is.

1729
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,120
This is THE Literal Ironforge,

1730
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,240
the one that this city is named for,

1731
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,640
well known far beyond its limits.

1732
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,680
And you are telling me you can't build a
little device with less than a dozen parts?

1733
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,160
Not even with a model to work from?

1734
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,600
I am deeply

1735
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,600
disappointed.

1736
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,920
Oh, it is a small device, that's true.

1737
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,600
But there's a lot more
to it than meets the eye.

1738
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,640
The humans were amazing blacksmiths.

1739
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,560
Then consider it a challenge!

1740
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,680
This is a challenge,

1741
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,960
if I've ever seen one.

1742
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,480
Did you get to examine
the ammunition I sent you?

1743
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,320
Of course.

1744
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,320
The bullets are like pieces of art,

1745
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,360
each one a marvel of precision.

1746
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,800
I've never seen anything like it before.

1747
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,440
I think we could make a few,

1748
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,160
but it will take a long
time and a lot of work.

1749
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,560
Then what are you waiting for?

1750
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,120
Get down to it!

1751
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,656
I'm beginning to wonder what the hell

1752
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,680
I'm paying you for.

1753
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:48,400
Yes, sir.

1754
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,640
Of course, sir.

1755
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,600
I hope you are aware

1756
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,000
though that the bullets
will be useless without

1757
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,240
the black powder that
makes them go bang.

1758
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,920
Do I look like an idiot?

1759
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,680
The finest alchemists of
the city are working on it.

1760
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,080
As soon as we have figured out the formula,

1761
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,400
you will get your powder.

1762
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,760
Now what is keeping us from

1763
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,480
building our own guns again?

1764
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,640
The material.

1765
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,760
Even our strongest iron does
not seem to be hard enough.

1766
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,080
Not hard enough?

1767
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,960
You are known to make
the hardest iron in the world.

1768
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,600
It is like it is.

1769
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:20,880
We've not been able to fire more than a
handful of shots before the gun breaks.

1770
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,960
And the aim is terrible.

1771
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,360
I'm at my wits end.

1772
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,000
I paid you a fortune to produce

1773
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,520
a reliable gun and you said you can do it.

1774
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,680
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

1775
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,240
And if you want your

1776
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,640
money back, I can totally understand that.

1777
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,440
Let me talk to the cashier and I...

1778
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,080
Listen to me, you little dimwit.

1779
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,040
I am Whisperwind of Ironforge.

1780
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,560
You don't bail out on me like that.

1781
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:47,000
There are not many parts
of the city that I do not own.

1782
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:49,240
These guns were built before

1783
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,600
and if you ever want to do
any business in this town again,

1784
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,920
you are going to find out

1785
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,480
how to build them again.

1786
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,040
Understood?

1787
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,440
But it is...

1788
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,040
but it is impossible.

1789
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,600
Then what would it
take to make it possible?

1790
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,680
The knowledge of a human blacksmith.

1791
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,560
All right,

1792
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,200
then this is what I shall get for you.

1793
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,440
And how are you going to do that?

1794
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,200
Break into the Holy Mountain
and steal all their books?

1795
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:20,520
There is no need to break in
if you know who has the key.

1796
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,320
I have to go and make a few arrangements.

1797
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:24,760
You're going to hear from me.

1798
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,880
Please excuse me.

1799
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:31,560
Ah...

1800
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:39,240
Hold still.

1801
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:43,320
Slow.

1802
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,880
Come on.

1803
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,040
Careful, careful.

1804
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,160
Oh, fuck.

1805
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,280
It hurts.

1806
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,200
Don't move your arm.

1807
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,200
It looks a lot worse than it is.

1808
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,520
Don't touch me.

1809
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,640
I just want to help you.

1810
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,640
I said don't touch me! Please,

1811
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,360
Rainy.

1812
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,440
Let me explain.

1813
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,000
Shut

1814
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:08,680
up.

1815
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,520
Just shut up! No,

1816
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,640
no.

1817
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,720
Please, let me explain.

1818
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,240
Just don't move your arm, okay?

1819
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,800
No, no, no, don't touch it.

1820
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:22,760
Don't pull it.

1821
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,800
Don't.

1822
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,040
It will just...

1823
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,320
Great.

1824
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,000
Now you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

1825
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,400
So what?

1826
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,080
You are going to die if we don't stop it.

1827
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,200
Come here.

1828
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,560
I told you to leave me alone.

1829
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:45,880
Hold

1830
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
still.

1831
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,120
By the gods.

1832
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,720
Why can't you just...

1833
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,040
Why can't you just leave me alone?

1834
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,840
Because I care about you.

1835
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,560
Then why did you do this to me?

1836
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,560
Look,

1837
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,600
I didn't want this to happen to you.

1838
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,280
You shot the princess.

1839
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,400
You shot the goddamn princess.

1840
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,000
What the fuck did you expect?

1841
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:17,360
This barn hasn't been used since
old Barleycorn gave up his farm.

1842
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,040
We will be safe here if you stop yelling.

1843
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,120
You know this place?

1844
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,640
This is where I grew up.

1845
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,200
Wait.

1846
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,160
You grew up in Ironforge?

1847
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,320
Until I ran away.

1848
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,080
Why didn't you tell me?

1849
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,440
Because...

1850
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:46,480
You better be honest with me now.

1851
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,720
Because I was afraid you would hate me.

1852
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,120
Go on.

1853
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,080
My father died in the rebellion.

1854
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:59,360
I grew up only with my mother and
we were the only Riverhawks in town.

1855
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,560
Ironforge has always been
firmly in the hands of the opposition

1856
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:07,120
and there is just no place for
pigs in their vision of a new world.

1857
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,320
The Institute took us in.

1858
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,920
People tend to underestimate
the wits of a hawk and

1859
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,520
that made mother a perfect
spy against the opposition.

1860
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:21,040
She was the one who uncovered
the opposition's war plans.

1861
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,360
War plans?

1862
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:28,680
The sea of debris is
littered with human artifacts.

1863
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,360
But working weapons are extremely rare.

1864
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:37,440
They've been trying to recreate some of the
artifacts they found but with no success.

1865
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,240
Are you a spy too?

1866
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,640
No.

1867
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,240
I wasn't supposed to know any about this.

1868
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,440
But I was curious.

1869
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,560
When I pressed my
ear against the wall in my

1870
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,800
room I just could hear
everything they said.

1871
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,880
Where is your mother now?

1872
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,120
She's dead.

1873
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,520
She ran into a trap and got arrested.

1874
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:08,880
GoldenEyes decided to make an example of
her and scare the mob back into submission.

1875
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,760
She executed my mother in the
marketplace using this very gun.

1876
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,640
They tried to lock me up on the orphanage,

1877
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,240
but I ran away.

1878
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,840
I knew how to get
into the palace without

1879
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,600
getting caught so I
took the gun and I swear

1880
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,360
if I had known that it
needs bullets to work

1881
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,600
I would have killed
GoldenEyes right there.

1882
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,840
But the gun only clicked.

1883
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:38,680
You lied to me.

1884
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:43,560
You lied to me and the people
in Ferndale who took you in.

1885
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,400
You lied to everyone.

1886
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,200
You don't know how it
is to grow up as a pig.

1887
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,160
Being powerless,

1888
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,280
helpless,

1889
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,760
wearing a smile like a mask.

1890
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:57,440
This weapon was the only power I ever had.

1891
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,760
Who gave you the bullets?

1892
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,200
The man who took us to the city did.

1893
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,520
You know him as Amberleafs.

1894
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:07,240
Everyone else knows him as Whisperwind.

1895
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,520
Whisperwind.

1896
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:11,520
The man who just married Lady GoldenEyes.

1897
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,240
But why?

1898
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,000
And why you?

1899
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,360
How did he even know we were coming?

1900
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,200
It makes no sense.

1901
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,280
He secretly works for the Institute.

1902
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,960
Ironforge is still a
bastion of the opposition

1903
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,560
and GoldenEyes is
the key to reclaiming it.

1904
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:32,440
Whisperwind married her because it makes
him the legitimate ruler of Ironforge.

1905
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,800
But to remain in power he must remain
free of even the slightest suspicion.

1906
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:41,160
The opposition has been
searching for me since I ran away.

1907
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:46,680
And when Whisperwind heard that I was
among the kidnapped students from Ferndale,

1908
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,520
he knew where to look for me.

1909
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:53,120
And he also knew that
I was out for revenge.

1910
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:56,280
He made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

1911
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,120
Two bullets to make this a victory
for my mother and for the Institute.

1912
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:02,320
No.

1913
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,280
No, he is not one of us.

1914
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,720
This would have been
murder plain and simple.

1915
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,600
It would have been against all the

1916
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,960
principles the Institute stands for.

1917
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:16,840
If you had spent more than a day
at our school you would know that.

1918
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,760
Whisperwind saw your blind
hate for Lady GoldenEyes

1919
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,400
and abused you for
his own selfish reasons.

1920
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,040
And no,

1921
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,880
he is on the good side.

1922
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,160
Your side.

1923
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,720
And so am I.

1924
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,000
No, Potami.

1925
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,080
Hate is never on the good side.

1926
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,520
You taught me how to make love.

1927
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,080
I wonder if you even know what love is.

1928
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,000
You pretended to be my friend.

1929
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,120
But in the end all that
mattered to you was

1930
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,520
that I showed you how
to work that fucking gun.

1931
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,360
Am I right?

1932
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,680
No, that is not true.

1933
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,880
And when you shot that lady,

1934
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I was the one who took the bullets so you

1935
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,400
could get away.

1936
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:55,040
Right?

1937
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:55,840
No,

1938
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,760
no.

1939
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,520
Would you also...

1940
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,760
No, I even came back to save you.

1941
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,160
Yeah, right.

1942
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,720
And would you have come
back if your plan had worked?

1943
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,600
Do you think I might still
be useful for you after all?

1944
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:11,600
No, I did it because I love you.

1945
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,400
Save your breath, Potami.

1946
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:16,160
I am not going to play
this game any longer.

1947
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,400
I have real friends to find in this city.

1948
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,800
No,

1949
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,600
please.

1950
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:24,080
Fuck.

1951
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,200
Rainy!

1952
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,360
I am okay.

1953
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:29,160
Everything is just peachy.

1954
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,120
Be safe.

1955
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,480
No,

1956
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,240
at least take the gun with you.

1957
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,320
I don't need a gun.

1958
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,120
Nobody needs a gun.

1959
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:47,040
I'm on the good side
and I'm going to prove it.

1960
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,760
Whisperwind told me where to find him.

1961
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:55,800
We will free the students and find the
kidnappers and put an end to all of this.

1962
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,480
And please,

1963
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,000
please be wrong.

1964
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:08,240
By the gods, please be wrong.

1965
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:19,240
Rocky! Hey, Rocky!

1966
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,480
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1967
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,280
Stop swearing on the job.

1968
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,000
You know, the gods are always listening.

1969
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,480
Which ones?

1970
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,680
The ones in the holy mountain
that turned out not to exist?

1971
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,440
Or the other ones who let this shit happen?

1972
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,680
You're a hopeless case.

1973
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,840
Hope?

1974
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,520
I must have lost that motherfucker
somewhere between all the dead bodies.

1975
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,080
Let me know if you find it.

1976
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,320
Anyway,

1977
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,960
meet your new volunteer,

1978
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,480
Honeyfoot of Ferndale.

1979
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,080
Hello, honey.

1980
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:51,840
Oh,

1981
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,600
please, don't call me honey.

1982
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,840
My friends call me foot.

1983
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,360
I hope you're going to last
longer than the guy before you,

1984
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:58,760
honey.

1985
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,240
I shall do my best.

1986
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,360
And again,

1987
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:02,960
please call me foots,

1988
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:04,160
not honey.

1989
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:08,240
Look, honey, I've stopped
counting how many helpers I had.

1990
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,960
I couldn't care less what
your fucking name is,

1991
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,600
because tomorrow you'll
be gone like everyone else.

1992
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:16,120
Listen, you weasel-headed cockwomble.

1993
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,320
I don't fucking care what
your shit-ass problem is.

1994
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,760
If you don't want my help,

1995
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,680
you can go take a flying
fuck at a rolling donut.

1996
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,560
You worthless, fucking cockspot.

1997
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:32,800
Oh, oh,

1998
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,840
you know what?

1999
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,720
I like you.

2000
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,360
I think I really like you.

2001
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:40,200
Finally,

2002
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,960
someone who's not made of glass.

2003
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,480
Hello, foots.

2004
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,640
Name's Rocky.

2005
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,320
Welcome to Camp Freedom,

2006
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,040
your worst nightmare.

2007
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,600
I have a strong stomach.

2008
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,760
Yeah, that's what they always say.

2009
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,480
Here, take one of these.

2010
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,600
Tie them around your head
so it covers your muzzle.

2011
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,800
Ooooooh.

2012
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,760
Yeah, I know.

2013
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:02,960
Stings a bit in your nose,

2014
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,320
but you'll get used to it.

2015
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:07,080
It's nothing compared
to the smell of the bodies.

2016
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,481
This used to be the headquarters
of the Rebel Underground,

2017
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,440
until the Keepers found out about it.

2018
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,440
They came in the night,

2019
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,360
knocked everyone out
with their magic shock rods,

2020
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,120
then set the place on fire.

2021
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,600
Most of the Rebels burned to a crisp.

2022
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,360
However, some did not.

2023
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,120
Judging from where the bodies are,

2024
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,360
some of them must have woken

2025
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,640
up trying to escape the flames.

2026
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:29,640
Their remains are scattered
all around the place.

2027
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,760
Some have been eaten by the pig rats,

2028
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,080
and what's left of them is not pretty.

2029
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,560
And how do we go about
cleaning this mess up?

2030
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,480
The other team brings
the Rebels and all their

2031
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,240
belongings that made
it through the fire and

2032
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:41,840
line them up over there.

2033
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,120
Then it's our job to identify them.

2034
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,080
If we find out who they

2035
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:49,080
are, we send them back to their families
so they can be given a proper burial.

2036
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:52,080
Everyone else gets an
anonymous grave right here.

2037
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:52,720
Okay,

2038
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,480
I told you I have a strong stomach,

2039
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,000
so let's get started.

2040
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,240
Alright.

2041
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,160
Get one of the bags,

2042
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,280
I'll show you what to do.

2043
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,440
Let's see who's in this one.

2044
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,880
Ooh, we're lucky.

2045
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,160
This one's pretty much in one piece.

2046
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,376
We must cut his clothes off and see if
he's got anything on him that might tell

2047
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,240
us who he is.

2048
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,280
Documents, jewelry, anything.

2049
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,400
Gotcha.

2050
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,520
Hmm.

2051
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,560
Must have been a shirt.

2052
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,720
Well, the rest of him is charcoal.

2053
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,240
Oh,

2054
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,120
wait,

2055
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,680
he's wearing a ring.

2056
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:34,880
Good.

2057
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,800
If it's a wedding ring,

2058
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,440
it might have an inscription.

2059
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,400
But how do we get it off?

2060
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,520
We don't.

2061
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,760
Yuck, the finger comes right off.

2062
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,480
And it's a wedding ring.

2063
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,160
Goldeneyes and quicksilver.

2064
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,040
Oh,

2065
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,160
congratulations.

2066
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,360
Your first case is a celebrity.

2067
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:57,680
You mean this is Lord
Quicksilver of Iron Forge?

2068
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,400
The one and only.

2069
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,080
So the rumors were true.

2070
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,240
He really did join the Rebellion.

2071
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,440
Ah, well,

2072
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,040
and now he's dead.

2073
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,840
I hope it was worth it.

2074
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:09,280
Yeah, I hope so too.

2075
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,320
As much as I disliked the Keepers,

2076
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,360
at least they kept the lands united.

2077
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,640
Now, who rules the rulers?

2078
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,280
It's a small wonder we're
not at war with each other yet.

2079
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,440
Yeah, it's a very unstable situation.

2080
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,960
Oh, yes it is.

2081
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:24,680
Do you believe in gods?

2082
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:25,360
Nope.

2083
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,360
Neither do I.

2084
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,520
But I do believe in the good in man.

2085
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:32,160
So let's make sure the Lord gets
back to Iron Forge where he belongs.

2086
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Oh, excuse me, sir.

2087
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,560
What is it?

2088
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,000
I am looking for Longleaf's bakery.

2089
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,320
Longleaf, you say?

2090
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:57,760
Yeah.

2091
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:58,880
Why?

2092
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,840
Because, well, they say he makes the best
sweet rolls on this side of Serpent River.

2093
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,080
I've come all the way from Coldlay
to get some for my mother's birthday.

2094
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:13,160
Your story fills me with
determination and hunger.

2095
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,160
But nope,

2096
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:15,880
sorry,

2097
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,800
never heard of anyone called Longleaf.

2098
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,680
However,

2099
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,040
if it's sweet rolls you want,

2100
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,000
try Sugar Tooth on Vine Street.

2101
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,400
His almond pastries are delicious.

2102
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,320
Ah, okay.

2103
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,240
Thank you, sir.

2104
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,360
Have a good day, sir.

2105
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:29,440
Take care.

2106
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,560
Man,

2107
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,640
finding Longleaf can't be that hard.

2108
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,440
How many bakeries can
there be in a town like this?

2109
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,200
Excuse me, sir.

2110
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:44,320
Hmm?

2111
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,200
I'm looking for someone called Longleaf.

2112
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,520
Hmm.

2113
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:51,840
He's supposed to be running
a bakery here somewhere.

2114
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:52,960
Hmm.

2115
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,000
So you don't know him?

2116
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:57,520
Uh-uh.

2117
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:04,000
Oh, and he might be
wearing a symbol like this one.

2118
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,360
Listen, you little mongrel! Uh-huh.

2119
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,480
We don't welcome rebel
scum like you around here.

2120
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,760
Okay, okay, okay, easy, easy.

2121
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,560
This city belongs to us.

2122
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,200
Okay.

2123
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,600
If your friend ever lived here,

2124
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,280
we'd probably send him
to hell where he belongs.

2125
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,600
Now bugger off!

2126
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,160
I'm just here for the sweet rolls,

2127
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:22,640
honestly.

2128
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,960
I don't want to cause any trouble.

2129
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:26,080
Have a nice day, sir.

2130
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,280
Holy shit, that was close.

2131
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,760
This is not the Ironforge
that Ankur brushes books.

2132
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,600
No, no, no!

2133
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:44,800
Stop making a fuss already.

2134
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:45,920
I'm your friend.

2135
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,640
Longleaf!

2136
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,200
Thank the gods, I
thought I'd never find you.

2137
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:01,400
You have no idea what kind of huge and
dangerous ruckus you have been making.

2138
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,200
What?

2139
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:02,760
I...

2140
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,560
There's so much I need to tell you.

2141
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,360
But let's go somewhere else first.

2142
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,480
How about your place?

2143
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:10,760
My place?

2144
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,760
After shooting the princess and
asking bloody everyone for my name,

2145
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,920
while waving the bloody
tree of knowledge in their face,

2146
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,320
there is now a bloody
mob in front of my shop,

2147
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,440
smashing my windows.

2148
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,240
I hope you have a damn good
reason for showing up like this.

2149
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,960
Look, you're the only one I know.

2150
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:33,440
Lady GoldenEye has had the entire class
kidnapped from the school in Ferndale,

2151
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,440
but Putami and I managed to escape.

2152
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,880
I started looking for you
the moment we arrived here,

2153
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,200
but then we...

2154
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,720
You decided to kill Lady
GoldenEye first, in broad daylight!

2155
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:47,720
No, but Putami did it.

2156
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,000
I even tried to stop her.

2157
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,160
Oh,

2158
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:51,280
so it was her.

2159
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,440
You know her?

2160
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:54,560
Only know her mother.

2161
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:59,440
Without her, our presence here is down
to nothing more than a couple of veterans.

2162
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,560
Too

2163
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,640
bad you didn't go for Whisperwind instead.

2164
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,280
He is the one who deserves to be shot,

2165
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:05,440
not GoldenEye's.

2166
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:05,760
But...

2167
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,720
but Whisperwind managed to convince
Putami that he is with the Institute.

2168
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,560
I'd have expected her to know more
about the Institute than our codex.

2169
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,920
Well, what do you expect from a pig?

2170
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,280
Wow, stop right there.

2171
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,440
That's not how you
talk about your girlfriend.

2172
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,640
She betrayed me.

2173
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,280
She is not my girlfriend.

2174
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,280
Rubbish, of course she is.

2175
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,360
What even thinks she rescued you first?

2176
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,920
Coincidence.

2177
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,040
And why do you think she took you
with her all the way through Darkwoods?

2178
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,960
Because she knew she needed me.

2179
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:37,280
But she didn't need you
anymore once you were here.

2180
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,080
I don't know and I don't care.

2181
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,800
Really?

2182
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:46,160
Then why didn't she leave you behind?

2183
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:51,000
I have no idea.

2184
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:51,800
Boy,

2185
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,760
you are in full on denial.

2186
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,160
She cares about you.

2187
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:56,080
A lot.

2188
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,200
Don't you see that?

2189
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,800
Then why did she hurt me so much?

2190
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,600
Someone killed her mother.

2191
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,280
Imagine the pain she's gone through.

2192
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:08,160
When Whisperwind gave
her the chance for revenge,

2193
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:11,280
that made her forget everything
else and it clouded her mind with hate.

2194
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,960
Yes, it was wrong,

2195
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,600
but it can happen to any of us.

2196
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,440
Not to me.

2197
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,800
Well,

2198
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,080
let me guess who told
her how to use the gun.

2199
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,200
It was you, right?

2200
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:25,600
Yeah,

2201
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:26,880
yes, it was me.

2202
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,880
Did she ask you for it?

2203
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,600
So the truth is,

2204
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:32,600
you wanted to impress
your crush and your

2205
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,840
feelings made you blind
to the consequences.

2206
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,040
Like, for example,
that you were effectively

2207
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:39,920
teaching her how
to shoot the lady.

2208
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,520
So don't ever again say
it doesn't happen to you.

2209
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,640
It does all the time.

2210
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:49,360
So,

2211
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,720
you know where your girlfriend is now?

2212
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,160
She wanted to meet Whisperwind.

2213
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:59,040
He's an expert boyfriend
that'll walk right into his trap.

2214
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,720
I was mad at her.

2215
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,880
That means she deserves to die or what?

2216
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,320
I'm such a bloody idiot, ain't I?

2217
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:14,320
For God's sake, I'm such an idiot.

2218
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,120
Does she still have the gun?

2219
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,000
Yeah.

2220
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,160
Let's hope she'll shoot
the right guy this time.

2221
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,760
Stop being so goddamn cynical.

2222
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,440
Look,

2223
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,520
GoldenEyes doesn't want the public to
know she kidnapped innocent students.

2224
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:28,280
And Whisperwind
won't be too happy about

2225
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,600
witnesses to his conspiracy
running around either.

2226
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,000
And on top of all of that,

2227
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:36,960
the public thinks you're the
accomplices to an attempt at murder.

2228
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:39,760
The entire city is against us,

2229
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,080
literally.

2230
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:44,120
All we can do is get the news to
Ferndale and hope for the best.

2231
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:48,080
I wonder what Riversong would have done.

2232
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:49,400
Your father.

2233
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,520
Why would that matter?

2234
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,440
Because he was a hero.

2235
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:56,240
He went out of his way to save
my mother back during the rebellion.

2236
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,480
He's also dead.

2237
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:02,400
If it is my fate to die for a good cause,

2238
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:03,280
so be it.

2239
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,680
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

2240
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:07,480
I screwed up big time.

2241
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,920
I can't just sit here and wait.

2242
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,200
You're doing that emotional thing again.

2243
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,680
Just look at yourself.

2244
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,960
Your arm is still bleeding.

2245
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,320
You couldn't even hold a butter knife.

2246
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:19,960
You're crazy.

2247
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,080
Don't touch it.

2248
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:23,680
Better tell me where I
can find Whisperwind.

2249
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,640
Well,

2250
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,720
how would I know?

2251
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,880
He's probably either at home or

2252
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,880
telling lies to his wife.

2253
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,400
Or he might be spending
the night at one of his brothels.

2254
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:37,200
His brothels?

2255
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:38,640
You

2256
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:39,760
didn't know?

2257
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,040
The Cat House is
probably the only business

2258
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:46,360
in Ironforge that still
turns a solid profit.

2259
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:49,080
Extractions from misery are
in high demand these days.

2260
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,360
They let the sleaziest guy
in town marry the princess?

2261
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,560
All that matters is gold these days.

2262
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,840
And of that, he's got plenty.

2263
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,560
He's not going to meet
Botami at the palace,

2264
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,600
so they must be at the Cat House.

2265
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,560
Maybe.

2266
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:04,840
But what are you going to do?

2267
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,480
I'll come up with something.

2268
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,480
You go to get help from Furnir,

2269
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,000
and I'll go save my girlfriend.

2270
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:12,600
Oh, now she's your girlfriend again.

2271
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:15,120
Well then, good luck.

2272
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:18,600
Oh, what kind of flowers
would you like on your grave?

2273
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:21,000
White chrysanthemums for love,

2274
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,360
truth, and a long life.

2275
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,120
Oh, by the gods, grow up!

2276
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,880
Goodbye, Longleaf.

2277
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,560
No,

2278
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,080
you're making a mistake.

2279
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:29,560
The enemy's in the majority.

2280
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,760
I can't help you when...

2281
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:31,880
Goodbye.

2282
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:38,680
There he goes! He's the one! Let's get him!

2283
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,800
Fuck!

2284
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,640
Fuck! Fuck!

2285
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,440
Oh,

2286
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:03,640
what a surprise! Lady visitors
have become so rare these days.

2287
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,440
Welcome to the Cat House.

2288
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,560
My name is Snowflake.

2289
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,160
Is this your first visit here?

2290
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:14,480
Yes, but...

2291
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,360
There's no reason to be ashamed.

2292
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:21,520
This is the first time for everything.

2293
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:24,960
The Cat House proudly
caters to all species,

2294
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:26,960
sexes, and preferences.

2295
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,040
So,

2296
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:30,400
tell me,

2297
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,440
are you into boys or into girls?

2298
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,120
Or maybe even both?

2299
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,800
Maybe even at the same time?

2300
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:38,800
Um,

2301
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:42,760
I'm actually here to see Lord Whisperwind.

2302
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,560
Oh,

2303
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,960
you're here for an audition.

2304
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,560
Why didn't you say so?

2305
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,560
Um,

2306
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:51,800
when was your appointment again?

2307
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,960
I don't have an appointment.

2308
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,880
I just want to talk to the
Lord, if that's possible.

2309
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,240
My name is Potami.

2310
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:58,920
He knows me.

2311
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,680
That should be possible,

2312
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:02,520
but

2313
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,800
it may take a while.

2314
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:07,800
The Lord is terribly busy at the moment.

2315
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:09,640
No problem.

2316
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,560
I'm not in a rush.

2317
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:16,960
I hope you realize that just talking is
not going to get you a job here, right?

2318
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,480
I appreciate the advice,

2319
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,200
but I really just want to talk.

2320
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,040
All right, just saying.

2321
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:27,280
Can I fetch you something to drink?

2322
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:31,720
We have a whole new menu
with original human recipes.

2323
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,440
Um, I don't know.

2324
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,000
What would you recommend?

2325
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,880
There's a hot drink called coffee.

2326
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,200
And let me tell you,

2327
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:44,760
that one really gets your juices flowing.

2328
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,800
Um, sounds nice.

2329
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,880
Perfect! I'll get you one!

2330
01:48:58,520 --> 01:49:01,480
Well, well, Whisperwind.

2331
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,320
So,

2332
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:04,400
how does it feel to be a Lord?

2333
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:08,240
Oh, it's the most glorious
feeling in the world.

2334
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,400
Oh, even better than my pussy.

2335
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:15,440
Why compare when I can
have both at the same time?

2336
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:18,360
You're such a naughty boy.

2337
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:21,120
Cheating on your lady
on your wedding night?

2338
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:25,160
Getting rid of her turned out
to be harder than I thought.

2339
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,000
But next time I come to see you,

2340
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,640
it won't be cheating anymore.

2341
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,080
I promise.

2342
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,640
You know that my lips are sealed.

2343
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,520
You can come in any time.

2344
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,880
I'm always up for a good fuck.

2345
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,640
How much time do you have?

2346
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,000
I've got all the time in the world.

2347
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:43,080
Let's take it nice and slow.

2348
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,200
Oh,

2349
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:45,880
Whisperwind,

2350
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,840
you son of a rat.

2351
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,520
You're going to pay for this.

2352
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,640
I swear.

2353
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:53,080
You are so going to pay for this.

2354
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:56,000
Here's your cup of coffee.

2355
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,760
Black and hot,

2356
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,440
just as it should be.

2357
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:01,000
Oh,

2358
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:02,000
thank you.

2359
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,920
I've never had coffee before.

2360
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:06,920
Try it.

2361
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:12,400
Good, isn't it?

2362
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:20,320
Snowy?

2363
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:20,800
Yeah?

2364
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:21,920
Hey,

2365
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,880
he wants the slow routine tonight.

2366
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,720
Can you get me the cuffs and the blindfold?

2367
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:28,920
Sure thing.

2368
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:41,440
Here you are.

2369
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,560
Thanks.

2370
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,200
Now,

2371
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,960
it looks like this is
going to take a while.

2372
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,120
Are you sure you want to continue waiting?

2373
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,840
Well, it's not as if I had a choice.

2374
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,840
Oh, well, your decision.

2375
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,280
Enjoy your coffee.

2376
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,200
Thank you.

2377
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,360
Wait,

2378
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:04,840
Snowflake.

2379
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,840
Yes?

2380
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:07,760
Ah,

2381
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,880
you're right.

2382
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,480
Just talking isn't going
to impress the Lord.

2383
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:16,840
So I thought maybe you could
tell me a little bit about him.

2384
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,480
Like the stuff that really rocks his boat,

2385
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:21,360
if you know what I mean.

2386
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:22,880
If you want to,

2387
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,720
I could ask Moonshine if
she'd be up for a little chat later.

2388
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:28,720
She's the Lord's favorite,

2389
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,920
and she knows everything about him.

2390
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,040
Can you come back tomorrow?

2391
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,160
No,

2392
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:37,600
I only have time today.

2393
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:41,960
But maybe you could ask her,

2394
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,320
like,

2395
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,600
maybe she would let me watch?

2396
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,240
I like how you think.

2397
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:52,680
Well, you're in training already.

2398
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,840
You're such a kinky little pig.

2399
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,360
Oh,

2400
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:56,960
sorry.

2401
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,440
No offense.

2402
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,440
Just let me talk to Moonshine.

2403
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:06,920
Hey,

2404
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:08,040
Moonshine.

2405
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:08,600
Yeah?

2406
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:09,280
What is it?

2407
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,880
The young girl over there.

2408
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,040
She was wondering if
you'd let her watch, maybe?

2409
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,160
Yes.

2410
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,280
Really?

2411
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:17,880
Great.

2412
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Why not?

2413
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,920
Okay,

2414
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,640
Moony is fine with it.

2415
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:28,000
But you have to stay absolutely still.

2416
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:30,040
If the Lord finds out,

2417
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,880
we're going to lose
more than just our jobs.

2418
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Get it?

2419
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:43,720
Yes!

2420
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:59,200
Oh

2421
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:05,840
Yes,

2422
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:10,560
your paws are magic take
your time ladies take your time

2423
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:16,320
You can't imagine what
an exhausting day I have

2424
01:53:16,440 --> 01:53:17,840
weddings

2425
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:18,960
assassinations

2426
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:21,760
Yes, go on like that.

2427
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:25,440
Yeah right there so soft

2428
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:35,120
Whisper wind whisper

2429
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,680
Oh, well so much for the long routine

2430
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:50,280
Wow, that's the first time I've seen you
fall asleep with a pair of tits on his face

2431
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:54,560
He must be very tired
shall we wake him up again?

2432
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:55,240
No,

2433
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:55,600
please.

2434
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:56,160
No,

2435
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:59,720
I'm glad that I don't have to listen
through another night of confessions

2436
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,600
You should write a biography

2437
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:05,480
I totally could and I
could swear it turns him

2438
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:09,560
on it's like his personal
way of talking dirty

2439
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:11,520
What a strange guy.

2440
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,520
Oh, that's at least untie him.

2441
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:14,640
Okay

2442
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:38,520
I'm sorry little one that usually
plays out a bit differently.

2443
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:39,720
Oh, well

2444
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,520
Thank you.

2445
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,320
Anyway

2446
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:42,920
You did your best.

2447
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,680
Oh the only way to survive in this job.

2448
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:46,800
See you later

2449
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,760
I'm afraid you won't get
your audition today little one.

2450
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:01,840
Oh Yeah, it looks like it

2451
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,840
too bad you can't come back tomorrow

2452
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,880
You're remarkably sexy for a pig.

2453
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:08,640
Oh

2454
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,360
Thank you.

2455
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:12,080
That was almost not racist

2456
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:24,720
Okay,

2457
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,560
it's time for me to leave then

2458
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:30,000
Thank you for the coffee and the demo

2459
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,200
I've learned a lot today.

2460
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:35,320
Have a good night toodles

2461
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,280
Business seems to be slow today.

2462
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,320
Excellent.

2463
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:57,720
Now just you wait whisper

2464
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:34,240
I

2465
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:38,000
Think I'm going to keep those clothes

2466
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:43,200
Raindancers going to have
a stroke if he sees me like that

2467
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:26,600
I just

2468
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:28,840
fall asleep

2469
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:32,560
Damn that never happened to me before

2470
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:35,800
Are you still oh,

2471
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,880
oh, oh, yes you are

2472
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:41,480
Yeah, yeah

2473
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:44,880
Moonshine you are the best.

2474
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,040
Oh, that's stupid pig

2475
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:51,960
fights to shoot gold mice
at arm length Oh God, yes

2476
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,760
Then the other guy takes her down and

2477
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:58,280
bursts my busts my plan

2478
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:04,120
Faster moonshine faster
You know that bitch was

2479
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:08,000
one of the bloody hostages from Ferndale

2480
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:10,640
Turns out she is the
bloody daughter of that spy.

2481
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,440
We killed a couple of weeks ago.

2482
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:15,920
Oh Yeah Yes

2483
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:21,280
Told her I am with the Institute told
her everything she wanted to hear

2484
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:26,640
Stupid little pig was
so hell-bent on revenge.

2485
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:28,480
I didn't even have to pay her

2486
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:35,120
faster.

2487
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:40,920
Yeah, the irony is it was me
who made the lady kill her mother

2488
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,400
It was not me all along

2489
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:52,520
Careful with your teeth, huh?

2490
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:54,560
You know, I like it rough.

2491
01:58:54,680 --> 01:58:55,680
Don't you?

2492
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:09,640
You're going to love what
comes next What the fuck

2493
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:11,280
You

2494
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:16,440
Right iron forge

2495
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:21,520
and you betrayed gold not you betrayed me

2496
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:24,640
Because you wanted the
throne and you wanted it alone

2497
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:32,760
No matter what you do

2498
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:37,320
Neither will your best
friend from Ferdinand

2499
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:40,080
I can help it

2500
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:47,960
Is that all you got come on kill
me kill me do it push harder harder

2501
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:56,320
No, I Know you couldn't do it

2502
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,120
in the end.

2503
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:59,720
You're just a dirty little pig

2504
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:03,040
What did you just say?

2505
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:04,160
Yeah

2506
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:06,200
Dirty

2507
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:12,120
Pig nobody calls me

2508
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,960
Maybe

2509
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:33,840
you do deserve to die

2510
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,800
but enough blood has been spilled.

2511
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:39,720
I Need to put things right
and I really don't want to

2512
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,920
leave the nice ladies without
that body in their bedroom

2513
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:53,600
Who taught me oh

2514
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,840
What the fuck happened here?

2515
02:00:58,960 --> 02:00:59,600
Oh

2516
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:03,520
I Got my audition after all

2517
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:04,640
much

2518
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:08,400
The Lord just had the right of his life.

2519
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:09,840
He needs to rest

2520
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:11,800
See you

2521
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:22,800
Wow just All right May I
have your attention, please?

2522
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:38,960
I would like to bring out
a toast may all human

2523
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:42,600
knowledge be free and may
iron forge become great again

2524
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:46,360
to the opposition and our allies Cheers

2525
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:51,840
All right whisper wind
now you got to share

2526
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:54,800
the story what made this
such a good day for us

2527
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:57,880
Where are you not at the
execution this afternoon?

2528
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,520
Some of us still have to
work to earn a living, you know

2529
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,200
Fair enough fair enough
with today's execution.

2530
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:07,400
We killed two birds with one stone.

2531
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,720
I thought she was a pig Yes

2532
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:11,840
Yes,

2533
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:15,840
and she was the most important
informant for the Institute in this town.

2534
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:18,520
They are now officially deaf and blind

2535
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:24,200
But what is even more remarkable

2536
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:28,160
I got the lady to do the
deed herself in person

2537
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:30,360
Haha,

2538
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,720
I have finally managed
to convince her that the

2539
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:35,280
gun is the only thing
that keeps her in power

2540
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:38,800
She is all in I just started
a little operation that will

2541
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:42,680
hit the leaders of the
Institute where it hurts the most

2542
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:43,960
I can't tell you the details

2543
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:49,880
But these guys are so deeply ingrained in
their own ideals about peace and pacifism

2544
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,840
They don't even have
guards on their city walls.

2545
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:57,920
You could just walk in and then
do whatever you want like let's say

2546
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:02,680
Kidnap their children and then walk
out again and nothing's gonna stop you.

2547
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:03,800
Can you believe that?

2548
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:08,760
That means we will soon
have exclusive access to

2549
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:12,960
the blueprints to create
our own human weapons

2550
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:14,400
The forge is fired up

2551
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:20,920
Just a few days I will
be the lord of iron forge

2552
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,400
with our new weapons

2553
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:25,800
We will be the superior
power of all the lands.

2554
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,160
We will crush the Institute

2555
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:33,280
We will conquer the holy mountain and
we will unite the lands under our rule ship

2556
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:34,960
And this my friends

2557
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:39,200
this city will be the
new capital of the world

2558
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:42,160
The opposition will make
iron forge great again

2559
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,640
Dear mom,

2560
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:11,560
i'm sorry, you couldn't make it to
our wedding on such short notice,

2561
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:12,680
but I hope that

2562
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:19,720
Screw it.

2563
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,720
I'm not sorry and she knows it

2564
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:27,840
Dear mom,

2565
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:30,680
I am so glad you were
not at my wedding today

2566
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:33,840
Because someone almost killed me

2567
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:36,440
No,

2568
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,000
it's going to scare her to death

2569
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,040
Dear mom,

2570
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:46,880
I wish you were here right now

2571
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,120
Because this is my wedding night
and my blood in your husband is not

2572
02:04:53,880 --> 02:05:00,200
No, no, no, no, no, no No Too honest

2573
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,320
way too honest

2574
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:03,000
Damn,

2575
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:04,440
why is this so hard?

2576
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:15,440
Hello princess

2577
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:19,320
My god

2578
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:24,360
Please not so loud.

2579
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:28,360
We're in enough trouble as it is
and yelling will just make it worse

2580
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,520
Are you going to kill me now

2581
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:36,320
In cold blood like you killed my mother

2582
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:38,720
Oh

2583
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:41,200
That wasn't cold-blooded

2584
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:42,720
Believe me

2585
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:45,520
It was the worst thing
I ever did in my life

2586
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,360
They told me I had to give
the people a taste of my power

2587
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:52,480
I didn't want to but

2588
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:53,600
they insisted

2589
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:58,080
I drank myself senseless until
I thought I was ready to do it

2590
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:00,520
I had the gun

2591
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:03,440
I thought it would be easy just

2592
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:06,800
Pull the trigger and be done with it

2593
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,160
But it wasn't that easy

2594
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:12,640
Not at all

2595
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:18,840
You can't imagine how much time
I've spent waiting for this chance

2596
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:23,200
So many sleepless nights filled
with thoughts about killing you

2597
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:24,400
But you know what?

2598
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:29,960
I changed my mind

2599
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:33,080
Here

2600
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,120
Take the gun

2601
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:37,440
I don't want it anymore

2602
02:06:40,400 --> 02:06:43,680
Does it mean you forgive me

2603
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,800
No

2604
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:47,760
I will never able to forgive you

2605
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:51,560
But hate is a treacherous guide

2606
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:53,720
It turns you into a beast

2607
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:59,680
Sweet revenge dangling in front of you like
a carrot held by whoever rides your back

2608
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:02,400
If you didn't come for revenge

2609
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,000
Why are you here?

2610
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:07,440
To make right what I did wrong

2611
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:10,920
To save many lives including your own

2612
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,600
And to save Ironforge, my home

2613
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:17,000
And if you just have a
shred of good left in you

2614
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:18,120
You will help me

2615
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:21,040
You're very brave

2616
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:22,640
And well-spoken

2617
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:28,200
Yeah, I practiced my speech
the entire way from the cat house

2618
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:29,640
The cat house?

2619
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:31,040
Oh yeah, the cat house

2620
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:34,240
Whisperwind is not on your side

2621
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:37,440
It was him who gave me
the bullets to shoot you

2622
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:39,800
He knew that I was ready to do it

2623
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:42,880
We have a common enemy were his exact words

2624
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,520
That can't be true

2625
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,120
I swear it is

2626
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:49,960
From the very beginning
he was planning to get rid

2627
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:53,120
of you as soon as he's
the new lord of Ironforge

2628
02:07:53,240 --> 02:07:54,760
But it didn't work out

2629
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:58,480
And he is on his way right here
right now to personally make

2630
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:02,480
sure that his face will be
the last thing you will ever see

2631
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:05,920
And how are you supposed
to know about all this

2632
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:10,960
Because I was there when he
confessed it to his favorite whore

2633
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,080
You're lying!

2634
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:15,760
My lady! My lady!

2635
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:19,160
The lord just ordered the officer
of the guard to take you in custody

2636
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:23,960
I locked all the doors but that's
not going to stop them for long

2637
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:26,440
You must flee while you still can

2638
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:30,480
And how on earth did you get in here?

2639
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:33,240
This building has more
holes in it than a piece

2640
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:36,040
of Coldlake cheese and
my mother knew them all

2641
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,560
Whisperwind, you son of a whore

2642
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,440
I've never trusted him

2643
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:50,800
And I wish I had listened to you earlier
Is there anyone else left on our side?

2644
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:51,960
Unlikely,

2645
02:08:52,080 --> 02:08:56,320
he is the lord now No
one will dare to disobey him

2646
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:59,880
That means we're lost No, we are not

2647
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,800
There are still a few
friends around who will

2648
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:06,440
fight with us And you
are going to lead us there

2649
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,680
Me?

2650
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:09,200
How?

2651
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:11,160
Shhh!

2652
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:12,840
He can hear us

2653
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,440
Goldeneyes,

2654
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:15,720
are you in there?

2655
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:16,840
Open the door!

2656
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,120
Okay,

2657
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:21,840
now this is my plan Goldeneyes

2658
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:23,256
We will go there and I will not...

2659
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:24,336
Who else is in there with you?

2660
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:26,440
Open the door!

2661
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:27,840
This is an order!

2662
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:36,600
This is a great plan!

2663
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:39,480
I'll stay here and put
Whisperwind on the right track

2664
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:44,400
But this will be your end! You
know you don't have to do this

2665
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:45,600
Maybe,

2666
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:49,720
but I'm not a small
field I am a green field,

2667
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:52,680
my lady My decision stands

2668
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,560
Green field,

2669
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:59,200
you're the most honorable
man I have ever met

2670
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:02,680
I will make sure your name
will always be remembered

2671
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,720
Stop talking and follow me, okay?

2672
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:06,840
Alright

2673
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:10,040
Alright,

2674
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:12,360
you wanted it this way!

2675
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:28,360
Light

2676
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,400
so bright,

2677
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:33,960
light so pure

2678
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:38,040
Keepers of the light,

2679
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:41,280
answer me true Oh, for the last time,

2680
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:43,920
stop singing that song!

2681
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:45,880
I have to do something to keep me sane!

2682
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,240
Right now you're the
one who drives me insane!

2683
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,680
Guys, stop yelling at
each other! All we can

2684
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:54,120
do right now is be
patient and wait for help

2685
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:55,600
You mean pray for help?

2686
02:10:55,720 --> 02:10:59,840
Rubbish! Professor Bottlebrush will do
everything he can to get us out of here

2687
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:02,640
He will come! If he ever finds us

2688
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:08,440
Should be a breeze with all his human
science and weapons and gadgets and stuff,

2689
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:09,240
right?

2690
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,080
Then what is taking him so long?

2691
02:11:11,200 --> 02:11:12,920
Ironforge is a big city

2692
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:17,000
Do you really think he would
use human weapons to rescue us?

2693
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:19,560
Wouldn't that be totally
against his ideals?

2694
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,840
Not only that,

2695
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,040
couldn't that be exactly
what the opposition wants?

2696
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:25,680
There's no point in speculating

2697
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,640
What else should this be about?

2698
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,400
The opposition is not
exactly short on gold,

2699
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:31,560
that's for sure

2700
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:34,760
I wonder who of us
they're going to kill first?

2701
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,240
Shut your fucking piehole!

2702
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,040
I'm just stating the inevitable

2703
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:41,400
You can keep the inevitable to yourself!

2704
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,800
I hope Braindancer made it back to Ferndale

2705
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:46,960
Braindancer?

2706
02:11:47,080 --> 02:11:51,160
No way he's gonna survive the dark
woods on his own He hides under his bed

2707
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:55,560
every time there's a thunderstorm
I've seen it Then what about the pig?

2708
02:11:55,680 --> 02:11:58,000
She's a red river hog if you please Well,

2709
02:11:58,120 --> 02:12:02,240
pigs are tough She could have
made it Why would she help us?

2710
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:06,640
She did not make a single move to
rescue us when she had the chance Yeah,

2711
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:09,280
bloody pig! We're doomed

2712
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:12,760
I give up Feel as gloomy as
you like This is a free prison

2713
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:18,360
after all Light so bright Run not again!

2714
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:20,480
Light so pure Wait,

2715
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,600
did you hear that?

2716
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:25,280
If

2717
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:27,960
It's one of the Morans from the wagon,

2718
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:30,120
we might be able to
overwhelm him Do you

2719
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:33,400
think we can work
together just this one time?

2720
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:34,640
You guys go over there,

2721
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:35,920
and you guys go over

2722
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:37,520
there And on my command,

2723
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:41,600
we all jump If he's stupid enough
to come in here anyway Ouch!

2724
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:42,720
Shh!

2725
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:44,600
One...

2726
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:46,400
Two...

2727
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:48,520
Stop! Don't jump! What the hell?

2728
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:12,120
Ah, that's it!

2729
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:14,400
Everything is in place

2730
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:18,200
Now all we have to do is wait for
Whisperwind to show up and spring the trap

2731
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:21,480
I can't wait to make him
pay for what he has done

2732
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:24,080
If he shows up at all

2733
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:26,280
Greenfield told them where to find us

2734
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:29,520
He's way too proud not to show up

2735
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:33,880
Well, but he will have a
small army in town very likely

2736
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,040
We can only hope they are
still more loyal to you than him

2737
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:40,880
His power hangs by a thread

2738
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,120
People obey him to keep
their heads on their shoulders

2739
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:45,880
And that's it

2740
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,200
If we manage to take him out,

2741
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:50,120
they will be on my side,

2742
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:53,920
not his Let's hope so, by the gods

2743
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:58,480
I still don't know how you could
fall for a guy like Whisperwind

2744
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:01,960
Well, you fell for him too, didn't you?

2745
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:03,280
Touche

2746
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:07,640
He knows precisely how to
use your fears against you

2747
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:10,280
What were you afraid of?

2748
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:15,720
Losing Ironforge When Quicksilver
died, I was suddenly very lonely

2749
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:20,880
And all I knew about ruling a city was
what I had overheard at dinner parties

2750
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:26,920
Whisperwind was both an experienced
leader and an experienced lover

2751
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:30,120
He was exactly what I needed

2752
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:33,400
Also, I thought...

2753
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:35,040
What was the kidnapping about?

2754
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:40,280
The most important leaders
of the Institute live in Ferndale

2755
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:44,040
And Whisperwind was
mostly interested in weapons

2756
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:50,240
Being able to make our own guns would have
made us the most powerful city in the world

2757
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:55,280
So, we tried to blackmail Ferndale
into giving us access to the library

2758
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:59,080
And people say pigs are into dirty business

2759
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:02,480
I feel nothing but shame right now

2760
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:05,520
If I could turn back time,

2761
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:08,280
I would Oh, shh! I think they are coming

2762
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:24,320
Goldeneyes, I know you are
here Come out and show yourself

2763
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:26,200
Shall I give the signal?

2764
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:26,760
No,

2765
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:27,360
not yet,

2766
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:28,720
they are too far away

2767
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:30,760
There's no point in hiding

2768
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:34,000
Your friendly butler
sang like a little bird

2769
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:38,000
Come closer so we can talk

2770
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:41,040
Oh, is that the little piggy speaking?

2771
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:43,840
But I can hear you perfectly from over here

2772
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:45,920
I want Goldeneyes

2773
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:50,200
Send her out now and nobody gets hurt Shit,

2774
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:51,320
what now?

2775
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:51,960
Shh,

2776
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:54,560
patience If he wants to get us,

2777
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:56,080
he will have to move closer

2778
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:58,440
And then we will get him

2779
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:00,520
Goldeneyes is not here

2780
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:02,640
If you want to know where she is,

2781
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:04,200
come over here and we will talk

2782
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:07,120
Of course she's here

2783
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:09,360
Come out now, this is my final warning

2784
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:12,280
The final warning and then what?

2785
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,120
The final warning...

2786
02:16:14,240 --> 02:16:16,000
Before I kill your boyfriend

2787
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:21,080
Fuck! No! Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck! What is it?

2788
02:16:21,200 --> 02:16:22,480
He's got Raindancer

2789
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:25,520
The man who saved your life Oh,

2790
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:28,680
fuck, for fuck's sake, why
didn't I see this coming?

2791
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:32,200
Oh, stupid pig, stupid pig, stupid pig

2792
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:33,080
Okay,

2793
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:35,040
let's put an end to all this

2794
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:39,240
I'm going out there right now Shh, no!

2795
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:42,480
I still have an axe to grind with this guy

2796
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:45,200
You can still surrender when I am dead

2797
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:46,400
Now hide,

2798
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:48,120
I don't want him to see you

2799
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:52,880
And don't give the signal
until I tell you, okay?

2800
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Okay

2801
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:03,600
I'm so sorry,

2802
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:07,520
I just want to help you I love you,

2803
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:10,200
Potami I know Now shut up

2804
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:14,160
So,

2805
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:16,840
you want to play rough, Whisperwind?

2806
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:18,520
I can play rough too

2807
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:24,920
One false move and
you're dead Now let him go

2808
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:32,400
Oh, you stupid little piggy
But this is not going to work

2809
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:35,040
Don't push me! I know
that you don't have any

2810
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:38,920
bullets left I gave you two
and you wasted them both

2811
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:40,640
You're forgetting about GoldenEye,

2812
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:43,480
Stache You mean this one?

2813
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:44,600
Oh, fuck!

2814
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:49,640
And now you're going to hand me the gun

2815
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:56,040
I said hand me the gun,

2816
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,400
not drop the gun

2817
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:05,480
How long is this going to take?

2818
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:06,440
Okay,

2819
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,760
alright,

2820
02:18:07,880 --> 02:18:13,560
here is your goddamn gun I
hope you will kill yourself with it

2821
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:18,120
Just why do pigs have
to get mad on everything?

2822
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:21,760
But anyways...

2823
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:27,720
I think it's time to end this
story Farewell, little piggy

2824
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:32,000
My eyes!

2825
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:33,520
GoldenEye, no!

2826
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:49,000
My eyes! I can't see!

2827
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:54,960
In case you don't know the feeling,

2828
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:58,040
this is a sword against your throat

2829
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:01,640
So,

2830
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:03,720
what are you going to do?

2831
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:05,160
Kill me?

2832
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,400
I am the Lord of Ironforge!

2833
02:19:07,520 --> 02:19:08,320
No,

2834
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:10,600
you are not!

2835
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:13,000
You are a criminal,

2836
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:14,760
a trickster,

2837
02:19:14,880 --> 02:19:16,000
a murderer

2838
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:19,680
You are nothing without
me The people of Ironforge

2839
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:23,240
will never accept a
woman as their leader,

2840
02:19:23,360 --> 02:19:24,360
never!

2841
02:19:24,640 --> 02:19:29,280
I'm not one of your ally cats
My family has been ruling this

2842
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:34,840
city for many generations and
we never betray our own people!

2843
02:19:34,960 --> 02:19:35,800
So,

2844
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:38,200
who do you think they are going to obey?

2845
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,160
Me or you?

2846
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:42,200
Well,

2847
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:43,960
let's find out,

2848
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:45,080
shall we?

2849
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:49,320
Let the soldiers go!

2850
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:54,680
Now,

2851
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,560
give them back their weapons!

2852
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:02,600
So,

2853
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:04,200
my lord,

2854
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:05,960
what would you like them to do?

2855
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:09,920
GoldenEye is guilty of assault,

2856
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,440
unlawful detention and high treason

2857
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:16,400
Arrest her!

2858
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:18,920
I said arrest her!

2859
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:24,080
Soldiers,

2860
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:28,560
this man coerced me
into marriage under false

2861
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:34,120
pretence which is therefore
invalid Furthermore,

2862
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:39,640
I accuse him of attempted murder
of a serene and conspiracy against

2863
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:45,440
the House of Ironforge He shall
be tried in a court of law Arrest him!

2864
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:48,320
No!

2865
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:50,480
No!

2866
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:54,440
Let me go! She has no
right to issue commands!

2867
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:58,920
I am your lord! I am the ruler of
Ironforge! You can't arrest me!

2868
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
No!

2869
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:10,960
Oh,

2870
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:13,800
Douglas

2871
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:17,560
I thought...

2872
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:19,440
I thought I was going to die

2873
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:21,560
Oh, shh, don't worry.

2874
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:23,640
The little piggy is
back to take care of you

2875
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:30,160
I thought I could be a
hero like my father I couldn't

2876
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:32,120
I'm such a failure

2877
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:35,840
You don't deserve a fool like me Shh!

2878
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:38,440
Stop talking like that!

2879
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:43,600
Without you, we would all
be dead right now How so?

2880
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:50,080
I stuck the barrel into the dirt as deep
as I could before I gave it to Whisperwind

2881
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:52,400
And it went bang right in his ugly face

2882
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:54,920
You taught me that

2883
02:21:57,560 --> 02:22:00,160
I love you, Tami

2884
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:01,280
I love you too

2885
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:05,360
Shut up!

2886
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:10,360
Poor Tami,

2887
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:12,800
I am forever in your debt

2888
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:13,920
My kingdom,

2889
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,920
my gold, my life

2890
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:17,720
Whatever it is you want,

2891
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:19,960
it is yours Thank

2892
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:20,800
you,

2893
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:25,440
but all I've ever needed is
here in my arms right now

2894
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:31,160
And I was wrong about you You are a
much more honorable person than I thought

2895
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:34,280
I can't bring myself to hate you anymore

2896
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:36,280
Go,

2897
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:37,400
your city needs you

2898
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:41,520
And you told me you're bad at politics

2899
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:45,160
Truth lies beneath the mud,

2900
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:45,760
ancient pig wisdom

2901
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:51,240
Thank you And to you as well, raindancer

2902
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:54,640
Please let the Institute know that
I deeply regret what I have done

2903
02:22:54,760 --> 02:22:58,920
And that I offer myself to be
tried in an independent court

2904
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:03,440
And pay any kind of
compensation they desire I will

2905
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,840
But can I make a suggestion?

2906
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:08,960
Of course!

2907
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,560
The Institute and the opposition
know so little about each other

2908
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:14,960
Instead of building walls,

2909
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:18,160
we should open our gates
And instead of spying,

2910
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:19,680
we should teach

2911
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:22,880
We have so much to
learn The Institute needs to

2912
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:26,800
have an official
representation in this city again

2913
02:23:26,920 --> 02:23:28,920
Consider it done Well,

2914
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:32,000
if you really want to
spread your knowledge fast,

2915
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:33,960
just tell it to a sex worker of your choice

2916
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,680
But poor Tami, that

2917
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,480
was so inappropriate

2918
02:23:39,640 --> 02:23:43,680
The truth beneath the
mud, ancient pig wisdom

2919
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:46,240
And my lady,

2920
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:51,200
don't you have a lot of really
important official state business to do?

2921
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:52,840
Yes, but...

2922
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:53,440
And what?

2923
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:58,160
Oh, the sweet air of spring Whoa whoa whoa,

2924
02:23:58,280 --> 02:24:00,200
what are you trying to get at?

2925
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:04,520
You Wait What?

2926
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:08,280
Oh, I'm talking about private lessons

2927
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:09,480
What lessons?

2928
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:10,360
What kind of lessons?

2929
02:24:10,480 --> 02:24:15,160
Oh, by the gods! I want to
screw your brains out right now!

2930
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:17,680
No!

2931
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:24,320
Are you crazy?

2932
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:28,840
The princess of Ironforge
is standing right next to us!

2933
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:33,400
My my my! Look at the time!

2934
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:38,360
I totally forgot I had lots of really
important official speeches to do!

2935
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:45,080
Come on! I can't do this
with all of them looking!

2936
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:46,920
Help!

2937
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,280
Oh well! That's not going to be a problem!

2938
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:03,400
What?

2939
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:04,600
Lights out!

2940
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:13,240
So tasty!

2941
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:11,160
Open your eyes and here you'll see it all

2942
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:16,840
Where shattered shadows always fall

2943
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:25,840
Raise up your ears and
now you'll hear my will

2944
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:28,680
Righteous thunder,

2945
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:30,600
light-filled wonder,

2946
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:33,200
let their aura still

2947
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,200
Give them my path,

2948
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:37,560
I'll go through them

2949
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:41,520
Hold deep my hand, guide me right

2950
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:45,080
Bold and high so they can't see the night

2951
02:28:23,320 --> 02:28:26,200
Give them my path,

2952
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:31,920
I'll go through them Hold
deep my hand, guide me right

2953
02:28:32,040 --> 02:28:35,120
Bold and high so they can't see their last

2954
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,000
light

2955
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:44,840
Faster than sound, I long to
them With all the pull you're divine

2956
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:53,000
Bold and high, you'll be
forever, ever, ever mine

2957
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:00,800
Bold and high, yeah!
