1
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:32,625
I feel this uniform's weight

2
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:39,689
I feel its fabric of lies

3
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,163
Blinded by my sense of such pride

4
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,630
A fallen hero in time

5
00:00:54,416 --> 00:01:01,214
Some think I am wrong (so wrong)

6
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:07,659
searching for hope - oh

7
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:09,150
My brothers,

8
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,203
Oh, shadowy foe

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,963
You'll feel my scope.

10
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,443
What am I running from?

11
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:56,833
Is it inside?

12
00:01:56,906 --> 00:02:00,536
Cause I have now found a strength

13
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:04,196
Far beyond battered pride

14
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,696
Dark nights have set me free,

15
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:10,893
Eyes with no lies,

16
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:14,567
In all cats are beautiful

17
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:19,892
With love I can't deny.

18
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:31,816
But now it's time for a change

19
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:35,576
No longer chained in fear

20
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:39,142
A memory, a flame,

21
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:44,036
it burns...

22
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:58,980
So I run!

23
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,923
What am I running from?

24
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,063
Is it inside?

25
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:12,968
Cause I have now found a strength

26
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,587
Far beyond battered pride

27
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:20,017
Dark nights have set me free,

28
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,330
Eyes with no lies,

29
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,875
In all cats are beautiful

30
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:31,995
With love I can't deny.

31
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,900
I'd not found myself on my own

32
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:55,160
it took the dawn with her called on,

33
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,865
All the uniforms,

34
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,652
All the lies...

35
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,322
were gone.
